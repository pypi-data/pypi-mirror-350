`wakis` is a **3D Time-domain Electromagnetic solver** that solves the Integral form of Maxwell's equations using the Finite Integration Technique (FIT) numerical method. It computes the longitudinal and transverse **wake potential and beam-coupling impedance** from the simulated electric and magnetic fields. It is also a multi-purpose solver, capable of simulating planewaves interaction with nano-structures, optical diffraction, and much more!

## About
🚀 Some of `wakis` features:
* Wake potential and impedance calculations for particle beams with different relativistic $\beta$
* Material tensors: permittivity $\varepsilon$, permeability $\mu$, conductivity $\sigma$. Possibility of anisotropy.
* CAD geometry importer (`STL` & `STEP` format) for definition of embedded boundaries and material regions, based on [`pyvista`](https://github.com/pyvista/pyvista) 
* Boundary conditions: PEC, PMC, Periodic, ABC-FOEXTRAP, Perfect Matched Layers (PML)
* Different time-domain sources: particle beam, planewave, gaussian wavepacket
* 100% python, fully exposed API (material tensors, fields $E$, $H$, $J$). Matrix operators based on `numpy` and `scipy.sparse` routines ensure fast calculations.
* 1d, 2d, 3d built-in plotting on-the-fly
* Optimized memory consumption
* GPU acceleration using `cupy/cupyx`
* CUDA-aware MPI parallelization with `mpi4py` and `ipyparallel` *coming soon!*

🧩 Other complementary tools in the ecosystem:
* Wakefield extrapolation via broadband resonator fitting with PIML [`iddefix`](https://github.com/ImpedanCEI/IDDEFIX) evolutionary algorithms
* Non-equidistant Filon Fourier integration with [`neffint`](https://github.com/ImpedanCEI/neffint)
* Beam-induced heating estimation due to impedance with [`bihc`](https://github.com/ImpedanCEI/BIHC)

## Motivation
🎯 The determination of electromagnetic wakefields and their impact on accelerator performance is a significant issue in current accelerator components. These wakefields, which are generated within the accelerator vacuum chamber as a result of the interaction between the structure and a passing beam, can have significant effects on the machine. 
These effects can be characterized through the beam coupling impedance in the frequency domain and wake potential in the time domain. Accurate evaluation of these properties is essential for predicting dissipated power and maintaining beam stability. 
`wakis` is an open-source tool that can compute wake potential and impedance for both longitudinal and transverse planes for general 3D structures. 

* 🌱 `wakis` was firstly presented at the **International Particle Accelerator Conference in 2023** (IPAC23) as a post-processing tool: https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2023-WEPL170
  
* 🌳 It has now evolved from a post-processing tool to a full 3D electromagnetic, time domain solver; and has been presented at the **14th International Computational Accelerator Physics Conference in 2024** (ICAP24): https://indico.gsi.de/event/19249/contributions/82636/
