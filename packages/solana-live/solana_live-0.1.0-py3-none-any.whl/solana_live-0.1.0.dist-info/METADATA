## Features

- **Ethereum (Uniswap, Sushiswap, Pancakeswap)**: 
  - Fetch prices of tokens.
  - Get pair address and reserves for token pairs.
  - Retrieve token symbol, total supply, and decimals.
  - Get the current block number and gas price.
  
- **Solana (Serum)**:
  - Fetch prices from Serum DEX on Solana.
  - Get the token balance of any Solana address.
  - Retrieve Solana transaction fees and account balances.

- **Utilities**:
  - Fetch the total supply of ERC-20 tokens.
  - Retrieve Solana transaction statuses.
  - Convert Base58 addresses to Solana public keys.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Install required libraries via `pip`:
