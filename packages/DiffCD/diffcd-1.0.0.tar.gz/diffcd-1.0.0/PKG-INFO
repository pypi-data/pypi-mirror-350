# DiffCD

A Content Discovery tool using response diffing for finding more interesting/hidden content on web applications.

- [Disclaimers](https://github.com/WillIWas123/DiffCD#disclaimers)
- [Requirements](https://github.com/WillIWas123/DiffCD#requirements)
- [Why](https://github.com/WillIWas123/DiffCD#usecases)
- [Help](https://github.com/WillIWas123/DiffCD#example-usage)

## Disclaimers

- This is considered to be a beta release, and may contain bugs and unintentional behavior. Consider yourself warned!

## Requirements

DiffCD requires [HTTPDiff](https://github.com/WillIWas123/HTTPDiff) and [HTTPInsert](https://github.com/WillIWas123/HTTPInsert) and can be install with `python3 -m pip install httpdiff httpinsert` or `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Why

Why create another content discovery tool when so many already exists?

Most (not all) content discovery tools rely solely on status codes for determining which endpoints "exists". Many applications have endpoints that are hidden due to the status code being the same as non-existant endpoints. Some websites even changes the reason phrase(!) and nothing else for certain endpoint. These types of behavior is really interesting when performing a pentest and can yield information about configuration etc. Relying only on the status code is a poor strategy resulting in subpar output. [HTTPDiff](https://github.com/WillIWas123/HTTPDiff) analyzes all parts of the response; the status code, reason, headers, body, response times, errors, etc., this allows to find some interesting endpoints impossible to find with traditional tools, or even manually.

DiffCD uses [HTTPDiff](https://github.com/WillIWas123/HTTPDiff) to determine the normal behavior of an application and checks for any differences when scanning for endpoints. This way it is possible to find endpoints based on any change of behavior, not only limited to the status code!

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -e EXTENSIONS [EXTENSIONS ...], --extensions EXTENSIONS [EXTENSIONS ...]
  -w WORDLIST, --wordlist WORDLIST
                        Specify wordlist to scan for filenames (extensions will be appended to all filenames)
  --original-target ORIGINAL_TARGET

target:
  -u URL, --url URL
  -r REQUEST, --request REQUEST, --req REQUEST
                        Specify a file containing a raw request for scanning

request:
  -t THREADS, --threads THREADS

  -m METHOD, --method METHOD
  --header HEADER [HEADER ...]
  -b BODY, --body BODY  Specify content to be in the body of the request
  --https, --tls
  --verify              Verify SSL certificates

  -d, --debug

scan:
  -s SLEEP, -ss SLEEP, --sleep SLEEP
                        Determines how long (ms) the scanner should sleep between each request during scan
  -cs CALIBRATION_SLEEP, --calibration-sleep CALIBRATION_SLEEP
                        Determines how long (ms) the scanner should sleep between each request while calibrating
  --timeout TIMEOUT     Determines the timeout duration (s) for each request
  -ie, --ignore-errors  Ignore errors if any errors occurs during calibration

analyzer:
  --no-analyze-all      Make analyzer skip analyzing the body if the content length is static
