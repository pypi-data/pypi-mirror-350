class DynamicLossScaling(eqx.Module):
    """
    Implements dynamic loss scaling for mixed precision training in JAX.
    The basic structure is taken from jmp.
    This class automatically adjusts the loss scaling factor during training to prevent
    numerical underflow/overflow when using reduced precision (e.g., float16). The scaling
    factor is increased periodically if gradients are finite, and decreased if non-finite
    gradients are detected, within specified bounds.
    Attributes:
        loss_scaling (jnp.ndarray): Current loss scaling factor.
        min_loss_scaling (jnp.ndarray): Minimum allowed loss scaling factor.
        counter (jnp.ndarray): Counter for tracking update periods.
        factor (int): Multiplicative factor for adjusting loss scaling.
        period (int): Number of steps between potential increases of loss scaling.
    Methods:
        scale(tree):
            Scales all leaves of a pytree by the current loss scaling factor.
        unscale(tree):
            Unscales all leaves of a pytree by the inverse of the current loss scaling factor,
            casting the result to float32.
        adjust(grads_finite: jnp.ndarray) -> 'DynamicLossScaling':
            Returns a new DynamicLossScaling instance with updated loss scaling and counter,
