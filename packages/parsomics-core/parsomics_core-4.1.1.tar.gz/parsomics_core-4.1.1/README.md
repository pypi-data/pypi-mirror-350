# `parsomics-core`

A tool for parsing omics data into a relational database.

##  Background

The development of the `parsomics` project (which now includes
[parsomics-core](https://gitlab.com/parsomics/parsomics-core),
[parsomics-api-server](https://gitlab.com/parsomics/parsomics-api-server),
[parsomics-plugin-interpro](https://gitlab.com/parsomics/parsomics-plugin-interpro),
etc) was driven by the needs of prokaryote metagenomics research, though aims
to be adaptable to other studies within bioinformatics. It was created at the
[Brazilian Biorenewables National Laboratory (LNBR)](https://lnbr.cnpem.br/)
within the [Brazilian Center for Research in Energy](https://cnpem.br/) and
Materials (CNPEM).
