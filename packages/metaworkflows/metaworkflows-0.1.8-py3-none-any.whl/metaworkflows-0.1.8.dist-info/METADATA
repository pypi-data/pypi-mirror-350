**MetaWorkflows** is a Python framework designed to declaratively build and execute Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) jobs using simple and intuitive YAML configurations. It abstracts away the boilerplate code typically associated with data pipelines, allowing data engineers and analysts to focus on the logic of their data transformations.

Currently, MetaWorkflows provides robust support for Apache Spark as an execution engine, with a flexible architecture designed for future expansion to other engines and connectors.

## Key Features & Benefits

*   **Declarative ETL:** Define complex data pipelines using human-readable YAML.
*   **Reduced Boilerplate:** Focus on *what* data operations to perform, not *how* to code them from scratch.
*   **Engine Agnostic (Design):** While currently focused on Spark, the framework is designed to be extensible to other processing engines (e.g., Pandas, Dask).
*   **Connector Abstraction:** Easily read from and write to various data sources (databases, file systems, object storage) by defining connections separately.
*   **Reproducibility & Versioning:** YAML configurations can be version-controlled alongside your code, ensuring reproducible ETL jobs.
*   **Rapid Development:** Quickly prototype and iterate on ETL workflows.
*   **Spark Integration:** Leverage the power of Apache Spark for distributed data processing.
*   **SQL Transformations:** Define complex transformations using familiar SQL syntax directly within your Spark jobs.
*   **Others:** No need to known python, spark :D

## Prerequisites

*   Python 3.10+
*   `pip` for installing packages
*   **Apache Spark:** If using the `spark` engine, you need a working Spark installation (local mode or a cluster). Ensure `SPARK_HOME` is set and Spark binaries are in your `PATH`, or that your Python environment is configured to find PySpark.
*   **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Required by Spark.
*   **Database Drivers:** If connecting to databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL), ensure the necessary JDBC driver JARs are accessible to Spark. You can specify them in the `spark.jars.packages` configuration within your job YAML.

## Installation

Install MetaWorkflows using pip:

```bash
pip install metaworkflows
```

## Quick Start
Let's walk through setting up and running a simple ETL job.

### 1. Project Structure
Organize your project as follows:

```
my_etl_project/
├── connections/
│   └── connections.yaml      # Database, filesystem, etc. credentials and settings
├── jobs/
│   └── etl/
│       └── spark_job.yaml    # Your ETL job definition
└── main.py           # Your Python script to execute the job
```

### 2. Define Connections

#### Use connection file (DEPRECATED)
Create a connections/connections.yaml file. This file stores connection details for your data sources and sinks, keeping them separate from your job logic.

##### Example connections/connections.yaml:

```
connections:
  my_postgres_db:
    type: postgresql # or jdbc for generic
    host: "localhost"
    port: 5432
    database: "mydatabase"
    user: "user"
    password: "password" # Consider using environment variables or a secrets manager for production
    # driver: "org.postgresql.Driver" # Usually auto-detected for known types

  my_mysql_db:
    type: mysql # or jdbc
    host: "localhost"
    port: 3306
    database: "magedb"
    user: "user"
    password: "password"
    # driver: "com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver"

  local_filesystem:
    type: file_system # A conceptual type, actual path used in write step
    base_path: "/tmp/metaworkflows_output/" # Optional base path
```
Note: For production, always use a secure way to manage secrets (e.g., environment variables, HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).

#### Use Secret Manager
```python
#TODO
```

### 3. Define Your Job
Create your job definition file, for example, jobs/etl/spark_job.yaml (using the example you provided):

```
# jobs/etl/spark_job.yaml
job_name: process_sales_data_spark
description: "ETL job to process sales data using Spark, transform with SQL, and write to object storage."
version: "1.0"

engine:
  type: spark
  config: # Spark specific configurations
    spark.app.name: "SalesDataProcessing"
    spark.master: "local[*]" # Or your cluster URL yarn, mesos, etc.
    spark.executor.memory: "1g"
    spark.driver.memory: "1g"
    # Ensure necessary JDBC drivers are available for Spark
    spark.jars.packages: "org.postgresql:postgresql:42.7.5,com.mysql:mysql-connector-j:8.3.0"

steps:
  - step_name: read_candidates_data
    type: read
    connector: database
    connection_ref: "my_postgres_db" # Reference to connections.yaml
    options:
      query: "SELECT id, name, phone, date, address, city, region FROM public.candidates WHERE city <> 'Hạ Long'"
    output_alias: "df_candidates"

  - step_name: read_emp_banks
    type: read
    connector: database
    connection_ref: "my_mysql_db"
    options:
      query: "SELECT id, id_emp, bank_acc, bank_name FROM mageai.emp_banks"
    output_alias: "df_emp_banks"

  - step_name: transform_candidates_full
    type: transform
    engine_specific:
      spark_sql:
        temp_views:
          - alias: candidates
            dataframe: "df_candidates"
          - alias: emp_banks
            dataframe: "df_emp_banks"
        query: |
          SELECT
            c.*,
            e.bank_acc,
            e.bank_name
          FROM candidates as c
          LEFT JOIN emp_banks as e
          on c.id = e.id_emp
    input_aliases: ["df_candidates", "df_emp_banks"]
    output_alias: "df_transformed_candidates_banks"

  - step_name: write_transformed_data
    type: write
    connector: file # Could also be 'object_storage' or 'database'
    connection_ref: "local_filesystem" # Refer to a connection if it provides base paths or credentials
    input_alias: "df_transformed_candidates_banks"
    options:
      path: "processed_candidates/" # Relative to local_filesystem.base_path or absolute
      format: "parquet"
      mode: "overwrite"
```

### 4. Run the Pipeline
Test job configuration file:
```python
from metaworkflows.utils import JobValidator

print(JobValidator.validate_yaml_file("jobs/etl/your_job.yaml"))
```

To run an ETL job via the command line:

```bash
python -m metaworkflows.main run_job --job-path jobs/etl/your_job.yaml
```

Or programmatically from main file:

```python
from metaworkflows.core.pipeline import Pipeline
from metaworkflows.core.job import Job

# Ensure your current working directory is the project root
job_definition = Job.from_yaml("jobs/etl/spark_job.yaml")
pipeline = Pipeline(job_definition)
pipeline.run()
```

Submit job to Dataproc GCP:

```python
#TODO
```

## YAML Configuration Deep Dive

### Job Definition (`job.yaml`)

The core of MetaWorkflows is the job YAML file. It has the following main sections:

*   **`job_name`**: (string) A unique identifier for your job.
*   **`description`**: (string) A brief description of what the job does.
*   **`version`**: (string) Version of the job definition.
*   **`engine`**: (object) Defines the execution engine.
    *   `type`: (string) The type of engine (e.g., `spark`).
    *   `config`: (object) Engine-specific configurations. For Spark, these are standard Spark configurations (e.g., `spark.app.name`, `spark.master`, `spark.jars.packages`).
*   **`steps`**: (list) A list of steps to be executed sequentially. Each step has:
    *   `step_name`: (string) A unique name for the step.
    *   `type`: (string) Type of operation: `read`, `transform`, `write`.
    *   `connector`: (string, for `read`/`write` types) Specifies the connector type (e.g., `database`, `file`, `object_storage`).
    *   `connection_ref`: (string, for `read`/`write` types) A reference to an entry in your `connections.yaml` file.
    *   `options`: (object) Connector-specific options.
        *   For `read` (database): `query` or `dbtable`.
        *   For `read` (file): `path`, `format`, `header`, `inferSchema`, etc.
        *   For `write` (file): `path`, `format`, `mode` (`overwrite`, `append`, `ignore`, `error`).
    *   `output_alias`: (string) A name to register the output DataFrame of this step, making it available for subsequent steps.
    *   `input_aliases`: (list of strings, for `transform`/`write` types) Specifies which previously aliased DataFrames are inputs to this step.
    *   `engine_specific`: (object, for `transform` type) Contains transformation logic specific to the chosen engine.
        *   For `spark_sql`:
            *   `temp_views`: (list) Defines temporary views from input DataFrames. Each item has `alias` (view name) and `dataframe` (input alias).
            *   `query`: (string) The SQL query to execute.

### Connections 
#### 1. Use `connections.yaml` (DEPRECATED)
This file centralizes connection configurations.
```
connections:
  <connection_name_1>:
    type: <connector_type> # e.g., postgresql, mysql, jdbc, s3, gcs, local_file_system
    # ... type-specific parameters (host, port, user, password, bucket, etc.) ...
  <connection_name_2>:
    # ...
```
Using `connection_ref` in your job steps allows MetaWorkflows to look up these details.

#### 2. Use Secret Manager:

```python
#TODO
```
