[general]
# Log messages of level equal to or above the specified level are
# printed out. Supported levels are "debug", "info", "warning", "error"
# and "critical" (ordered from lowest to highest level).
# Default: "info"

#log = "info"

[key]
# Assign actions to the buttons of the controller.
#
# An action consists of type and content, separated by a colon ":". It
# is written in the form
#     <type>:<content>
#
# There are several types of actions: "key", "command", "cursor_up",
# "cursor_down", "cursor_left", "cursor_right".
#
# "key" action:
# The content part is a key name of the keyboard. That key will be
# triggered when you press the controller button. For example, if you
# set `a = "key:KEY_ESC"`, then the ESC key will be triggered when you
# press the "A" button on the controller. The available names of keys
# are listed in [1] with the name started with `KEY_` or `BTN_`.
# [1] https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/include/uapi/linux/input-event-codes.h
#
# "command"" action:
# The content part is a command that will be executed when you press the
# controller button. If you set `b = "command:touch ~/file.txt"`, then
# the command "touch ~/file.txt" will be triggered when you press the
# "B" button of the controller.
#
# "cursor_up", "cursor_down", "cursor_left", "cursor_right" action:
# The content part is a non-negative integer. The cursor will move in
# the corresponding direction by the specified number of pixels when you
# press the controller button.
#
# "scroll_up", "scroll_down", "scroll_left", "scroll_right" action:
# The content part is a non-negative integer. Scroll in the
# corresponding direction in the speed specified by the non-negative
# integer. Typical value is 100.
#
# Default: "" (No action is assigned.)

[analog]

# Default: 1.0
#

# The analog stick may not perfectly centered even when you are not

# close to the center. These two settings control the size of the idle
# range.
# Default: 1.0
