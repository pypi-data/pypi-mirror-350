# Joymote

Use Joy-Con or Pro Controller as remote control of Linux machine.

> Currently, only support Pro Controller. We are working on supporting Joy-Con.

## Requirements

- [Python](https://www.python.org)
- [uinput module](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.12/input/uinput.html)
  - Check whether the `uinput` module is loaded, by running:

    ```bash
    lsmod | grep uinput
    ```

    If it is loaded, you will see a line like `uinput                 20480  0`.
  - You can manually load the module by running:

    ```bash
    sudo modprobe uinput
    ```

  - You can also run the following command to load `uinput` modules automatically on boot.

    ```bash
    sudo bash -c "cat uinput > /etc/modules-load.d/uinput.conf"
    ```

  - Make sure you have the permission to access `/dev/uinput`.

## Installation

### Using pip

```bash
pip install joymote
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kkoyung/joymote.git joymote
cd joymote
# check out different version by tags
pip install .
```

## Usage

1. Copy the example configuration file to `~/.config/joymote/config.toml`.

    ```bash
    wget -o ~/.config/joymote/config.toml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kkoyung/joymote/refs/heads/main/config.toml
    ```

2. Connect to the controller via Bluetooth, just like usual Bluetooth devices. Tips: Press and hold down the tiny button between ZL and ZR buttons, for at least one second to enter pairing mode.
3. Run `joymote`.

    ```bash
    joymote
    ```

4. By default, joymote does nothing. Check out `config.toml` and change it to configure joymote's behaviours.

## Development

1. Clone the repository.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kkoyung/joymote.git joymote
    cd joymote
    ```

2. Run the code.

    ```bash
    uv run joymote
    # or
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    python install .
    python -m joymote
    ```

## Pairing two Joy-Con as one device

Use [joycond](https://github.com/DanielOgorchock/joycond), which is a userspace daemon, to combine Joy-Cons into a single device.

- Install and start. For example, if you are on Arch Linux, you can run

  ```bash
  yay -S joycond-git
  sudo systemctl enable --now joycond
  ```

- Then, follow [this instruction](https://github.com/DanielOgorchock/joycond?tab=readme-ov-file#usage) to pair the controller.
