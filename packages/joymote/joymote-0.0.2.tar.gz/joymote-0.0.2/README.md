# Joymote

Use Joy-Con or Pro Controller as remote control of Linux machine.

> Currently, only support Pro Controller. We are working on supporting Joy-Con.

## Requirements

- [joycond](https://github.com/DanielOgorchock/joycond)
  - Install and start. For example, if you are on Arch Linux, you can run

    ```bash
    yay -S joycond-git
    sudo systemctl enable --now joycond
    ```

  - Then, follow [this instruction](https://github.com/DanielOgorchock/joycond?tab=readme-ov-file#usage) to pair the controller(s).
- [uinput module](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.12/input/uinput.html)
  - Check whether the `uinput` module is loaded, by running:

    ```bash
    lsmod | grep uinput
    ```

    If it is loaded, you will see a line like `uinput                 20480  0`.
  - You can manually load the module by running:

    ```bash
    sudo modprobe uinput
    ```

  - You can also run the following command to load `uinput` modules automatically on boot.

    ```bash
    sudo bash -c "cat uinput > /etc/modules-load.d/uinput.conf"
    ```
