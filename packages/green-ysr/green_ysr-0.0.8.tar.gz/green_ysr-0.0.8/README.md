The aim of this package is the calculation of the local density of states (LDOS) of magnetic impurities interacting with superconductors. The model is a standard Green function model able to deal with anisotropic Fermi surfaces. See [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.105.245403) for details on the model.
