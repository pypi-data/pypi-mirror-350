## ðŸ§  How Logflow Stores Data

By default, Logflow stores all your developer thoughts in:

```bash
./logflow/
```

This directory includes:

- `daily_logs/` â€“ developer check-ins
- `ideas/` â€“ structured Markdown idea files
- `idea_log.md` â€“ append-only quick thought list
- `completed_log.md` â€“ a snapshot of done ideas
- `next_id.txt` â€“ internal idea counter
- `config.toml` â€“ optional config file

### Example Config:

```toml
[paths]
log_dir = "logflow"
scan_root = "parent"
max_recent_ideas = 5
```

Run `logflow init` to generate this layout and config.

Or forcibly regenerate:

```bash
logflow init --force
```

## ðŸ’¡ Use Cases

* Solo dev journaling
* Idea tracking across projects
* Developer time tracking & status reporting
* Task queue for future sprints

Logflow is designed to:

* Work with or without Git
* Require zero setup, but allow full config
* Help developers reflect, prioritize, and focus

It's built for long-term sustainability of developer thought.
