# How to set up FACILE-RS for a two-step release process and archival on Zenodo

## Overview
This HowTo will guide you through
 * setting up the GitLab CI environment for your project
 * establishing a release process based on pre-release tags
 * archiving your release on a Zenodo repository

## Prepare your codemeta file
You'll need your metadata prepared in a [codemeta.json](https://codemeta.github.io/create/) file. If you used [KIT's cookiecutter template](https://gitlab.kit.edu/kit/fair-rs/public/cookiecutter-kittemplate), you should be good to go already.

## GitLab Continuous Integration environment
1. You need access to a GitLab Runner that can run Docker containers. If your project is hosted on [the Helmholtz Codebase GitLab instance](https://codebase.helmholtz.cloud/), you will have access to a suitable shared runner. If your project is hosted on GitLab.com, you have access to free runners for a certain amount of minutes per month. If not, see [the GitLab docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/) for general information on how to set up your own GitLab runner.
In general, FACILE-RS should also be compatible with GitHub Actions. We did not test this yet. If you got it running, a merge request extending this documentation would be highly appreciated.

2. In your GitLab project, go to `Settings` -> `Access Tokens` and create a token with name `release`, role `Maintainer`, scopes `api` and `write_repository`. Copy this token to a safe place, we'll need it in the next step.
3. In your GitLab project, go to `Settings` -> `CI/CD`. Create the following variables which you can all [protect and mask](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#add-a-cicd-variable-to-a-project) to keep them safe:
  * `PRIVATE_TOKEN` with the value being the token created in step 2: this variable name will be recognized and used in the script `create_release`, and the token will be used to push changes to the repository.
  * `ZENODO_TOKEN`: a Zenodo personal access token with scope `deposit:write` (can be created on Zenodo in My Account > Applications)
  * If your project is private, you should in addition set the (masked and protected) variable `ASSETS_TOKEN` with the same value as `PRIVATE_TOKEN`: this token will be used by `facile-rs zenodo upload` to fetch the source code from the repository.

4. Protect the tags triggering the release process so that they can access the protected variables.
Go to `Settings` -> `Repository` -> `Protected tags` and add the following entries:
  * Tag: `pre-v*`, Allowed to create: `Maintainers`
  * Tag: `v*`, Allowed to create: `Maintainers`

5. Create the CI configuration in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in your repository.
You can find a minimum template for a two-stage release process below. There are a number of variables that should/can be adapted:
  * `PROJECT_NAME` where you replace `openCARP` with for example the name of your software
  * `RELEASE_DESCRIPTION` where you adapt the search term and can add as many additional release info as desired, see for example [here](https://git.opencarp.org/openCARP/openCARP/-/releases)
  * `CREATORS_LOCATIONS` and `CONTRIBUTORS_LOCATIONS` (optional, the latter being data curators) with paths or links to raw `codemeta.json` files. They can also be lists of those links (starting with `|` and then one link per line) or empty.
  * If you want to inform the data steward about the new release ready to be published, set the following variables:
    * `NOTIFICATION_EMAIL: abc@host.com` address of the data steward
    * `SMTP_SERVER: your.smtpserver.com` (a SMTP server not requiring authentication, e.g. `smarthost.kit.edu`)
  * Commented content in the code below can be uncommented in order to include all submodules in the archived release. If your repository doesn't include submodules, this content can be removed.
  * You can add further artifacts to be included in the archive by simply adding additional arguments to the `facile-rs gitlab publish` call in the the `release-create` pipeline.

## Test your pipeline
Just make a change to the repository with GitLab's WebIDE or push a local commit to the server.

## Tag a release

To initiate the two-stage release process, add a tag `pre-vX.Y` where `X.Y` is  your desired version number. This can either be done in GitLab via `Repository` -> `Tags` or on the commandline:
```
git tag -a pre-vX.Y
git push origin pre-vX.Y
```

Then, the prepare-release pipeline will run and
* reserve a DOI for your release
* update your `codemeta.json` with the new version, its date and DOI
* create the tag `vX.Y`
* not delete the tag `pre-vX.Y` as protected tags can only be deleted from the web interface
* upload your dataset to Zenodo
* notify the data steward by email that the release is ready to be published on Zenodo
