# FACILE-RS

This package (previously known as openCARP-CI) contains a set of Python scripts which can be used to perform tasks around the archival and long term preservation of software repositories. In particular, it can be used to:

* create a release in GitLab using the GitLab API,
* create a DataCite record based on CodeMeta files present in repositories,
* create a CFF (Citation File Format) file from CodeMeta files,
* create archive packages in the [BagIt](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8493) or [BagPack](https://www.rd-alliance.org/system/files/Research%20Data%20Repository%20Interoperability%20WG%20-%20Final%20Recommendations_reviewed_0.pdf) formats.
* archive the software using the [RADAR service](https://www.radar-service.eu),
* archive the software on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org),
* use content from markdown files, bibtex files, or python docstrings to create web pages in a [Grav CMS](https://getgrav.org/).

The scripts were created for the [openCARP](https://opencarp.org) simulation software, but can be adopted for arbitrary projects. While they can be used on the command line, the scripts are mainly used within the GitLab CI/CD or GitHub Actions to run automatically on each push to a repository, or when a tag is created.

An example of integration in a CI environment is provided in the [tutorials](https://facile-rs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/). An example of a more complex setup are the [openCARP CI file](https://git.opencarp.org/openCARP/openCARP/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml) and the [included subscripts](https://git.opencarp.org/openCARP/openCARP/-/tree/master/.gitlab/ci).


## Setup

### Prerequisites

In order to generate metadata or publish software releases using FACILE-RS, it is necessary to create a CodeMeta metadata file for the software (for example using the [CodeMeta generator](https://codemeta.github.io/codemeta-generator/)).

In addition, if you want to use our preconfigured automated pipelines, your software repository needs to be hosted on GitHub, or on a GitLab instance with [Docker runners](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/) available.

### Installation

FACILE-RS can be installed using pip:
```
pip install FACILE-RS
```

In order to use FACILE-RS from the command-line, we recommend to install the package in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html):

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install FACILE-RS
```

### Use FACILE-RS automated workflows

You can integrate automated FACILE-RS workflows in your GitLab or GitHub repository using our templates.
Each template provides a sample configuration for generating metadata and creating software releases with FACILE-RS.

## Documentation

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/facile-rs/badge/?version=latest)](https://facile-rs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

FACILE-RS documentation is available at [https://facile-rs.readthedocs.io/](https://facile-rs.readthedocs.io/).

It can also be generated using Sphinx from [docs/sphinxdocs](https://git.opencarp.org/openCARP/FACILE-RS/-/tree/master/docs/sphinxdocs?ref_type=heads) by running:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
make html
```
The Python packages in [docs/sphinxdocs/requirements.txt](https://git.opencarp.org/openCARP/FACILE-RS/-/blob/master/docs/sphinxdocs/requirements.txt?ref_type=heads) as well as FACILE-RS itself must be installed in order to generate the documentation.

## Usage

The FACILE-RS tools are available via the command `facile-rs`.
More details about its usage are available in the [documentation](https://facile-rs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apidocs/facile_rs/facile_rs.facile_rs.html) or by running `facile-rs --help`.

`facile-rs` expects a number of command line arguments. Default values can be set using environment variables (using upper case and underscores), i.e. the following lines do the same:

```bash
facile-rs bag create --bag-path=/path/to/bag
BAG_PATH=/path/to/bag facile-rs bag create
```

Environments variables can be set in the usual way, e.g. the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, but also in a `.env` file in the directory where the script is invoked.

FACILE-RS comprises the following tools:

### `facile-rs cff create`

Creates a [Citation File Format](https://citation-file-format.github.io) (CFF) file from a CodeMeta file.
An example output can be found [here](https://git.opencarp.org/openCARP/openCARP/-/blob/master/CITATION.cff).

Deprecated alias: `create_cff`

### `facile-rs datacite create`

Creates a DataCite XML file following the [DataCite Metadata Schema 4.3](https://schema.datacite.org/meta/kernel-4.3/). The information needed for this can be taken from (a list) of locations given as URL or local file path. `CODEMETA_LOCATION` must point to a [codemeta.json](https://codemeta.github.io) file. `CREATORS_LOCATIONS` and `CONTRIBUTORS_LOCATIONS` point to similar files which contain a list of `creators` or `contributors`, respectively.

For an example, see [here](https://git.opencarp.org/openCARP/openCARP/blob/master/codemeta.json).

Deprecated alias: `create_datacite`

### `facile-rs bag create`

Creates a bag [BagIt](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8493) using the [bagit-python](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/bagit-python) package. The assets to be included in the bag are given as positional arguments.

Deprecated alias: `create_bag`

### `facile-rs bagpack create`

Creates a bag [BagIt](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8493) similar to `create_bag.py`, but also includes a DataCite XML file as recommended by the [RDA Research Data Repository Interoperability WG](https://www.rd-alliance.org/system/files/Research%20Data%20Repository%20Interoperability%20WG%20-%20Final%20Recommendations_reviewed_0.pdf).

Deprecated alias: `create_bagpack`

### `facile-rs release prepare`

Updates the CodeMeta file for the given `VERSION` and `DATE` (as `dateModified`, current date if omitted). Useful to automatically get the version from a git tag and inject it into the repo's metadata file.

Deprecated alias: `prepare_release`

### `facile-rs gitlab publish`

Creates a release in GitLab using the GitLab API. A tag for the release needs to be created before and provided to the script.
An example output can be found [here](https://git.opencarp.org/openCARP/openCARP/-/releases).

Deprecated alias: `create_release`

### `facile-rs radar prepare`

Creates an empty archive in the [RADAR service](https://www.radar-service.eu) in order to "reserve" a DOI and an ID in RADAR. Both are stored in the CodeMeta file and can be used by the `create_radar` command below to include the DOI for this release in the deposited CodeMeta file. A detailed HowTo for releasing datasets on RADAR is provided in the tutorial [`03_release_radar.md`](./docs/tutorials/03_release_radar.md).

Deprecated alias: `prepare_radar`

### `facile-rs radar upload`

Creates an archive in the [RADAR service](https://www.radar-service.eu) and uploads the assets provided as positional arguments. The metadata is created similar to `create_datacite`. If the RADAR ID is already in the CodeMeta file, the existing archive is updated instead. A detailed HowTo for releasing datasets on RADAR is provided in the tutorial [`03_release_radar.md`](./docs/tutorials/03_release_radar.md).

Deprecated alias: `create_radar`

### `facile-rs zenodo prepare`

Creates an empty archive on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) in order to "reserve" a DOI and an ID in Zenodo. Both are stored in the CodeMeta file and can be used by the `create_zenodo` command below to include the DOI for this release in the deposited CodeMeta file. A detailed HowTo for releasing datasets on Zenodo is provided in the tutorial [`04_release_zenodo.md`](./docs/tutorials/04_release_zenodo.md).

Deprecated alias: `prepare_zenodo`

### `facile-rs zenodo upload`

Creates an archive on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) and uploads the assets provided as positional arguments. The metadata is created similar to `create_datacite`. If the Zenodo ID is already in the CodeMeta file, the existing archive is updated instead. A detailed HowTo for releasing datasets on Zenodo is provided in the tutorial [`04_release_zenodo.md`](./docs/tutorials/04_release_zenodo.md).

Deprecated alias: `create_zenodo`

### `facile-rs grav bibtex`

Compiles and copies the content of bibtex files in a similar way to `run_markdown_pipeline`. A [CSL](https://citationstyles.org/) can be provided.

Please refer to https://git.opencarp.org/openCARP/publications for an example setup.

Deprecated alias: `run_bibtex_pipeline`

### `facile-rs grav docstring`

Extracts and copies the content of [reStructuredText](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/) docstrings of Python scripts. Contrary to the other pipelines, this script does not copy one file to one page in GRAV, but creates a tree of pages below one page (given by the `pipeline` header). it processes all `run.py` and `__init__.py` files.

The `PIPELINE` and `PIPELINE_SOURCE` options are used in the same way as in `rum_markdown_pipeline`. In addition, `PIPELINE_IMAGES` specifies a directory where the images from the docstrings are located and `PIPELINE_HEADER` and `PIPELINE_FOOTER` options point to templates which are prepended and appended to each page. With the `PIPELINE_REFS` YML file, you can specifie replacements for the references in the rst code.

Please refer to https://git.opencarp.org/openCARP/experiments for an example setup.

Deprecated alias: `run_docstring_pipeline`

### `facile-rs grav markdown`

Copies the content of markdown files in the `PIPELINE_SOURCE` to a Grav CMS repository given by `GRAV_PATH`. The Grav repository is created by the [Git-Sync Plugin](https://getgrav.org/blog/git-sync-plugin).

The pages need to be already existing in Grav and contain a `pipeline` and a `source` field in their frontmatter. The script will find all pages which match the provided `PIPELINE` and will overwrite content part of the page with the markdown file given by `source`. If source is `codemeta.json`, the content will be added to the frontmatter entry `codemeta` rather than overwriting the page content. Twig templates digesting the metadata can be found in the file `Twig_templates.md` in this directory.

After running the script, the changes to the Grav CMS repository can be committed and pushed and the Git-Sync Plugin will update the public pages.

See [openCARP citation info](https://opencarp.org/download/citation) or [code of conduct](https://opencarp.org/community/code-of-conduct) for examples.

Deprecated alias: `run_markdown_pipeline`
