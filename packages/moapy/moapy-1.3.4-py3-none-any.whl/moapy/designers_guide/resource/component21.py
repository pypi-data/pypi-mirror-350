If the slenderness of a member is below this critical limit, second-order effects, such as buckling and geometric non-linearity, can be ignored, simplifying the design process. The calculation is based on an empirical formula provided in Eurocode, which accounts for factors like member shape, boundary conditions, and axial force. In this guide, default values are used for the mechanical reinforcement ratio or the effective creep ratio when these ratios are unknown, simplifying the calculation process.",
