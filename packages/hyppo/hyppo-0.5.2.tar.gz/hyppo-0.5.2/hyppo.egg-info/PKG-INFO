hyppo (**HYP**othesis Testing in **P**yth**O**n, pronounced "Hippo") is an open-source
software package for multivariate hypothesis testing. We decided to develop hyppo for
the following reasons:

* With the increase in the amount of data in many fields, hypothesis testing for high
dimensional and nonlinear data is important
* Libraries in R exist, but their interfaces are inconsistent and most are not available
in Python

hyppo intends to be a comprehensive multivariate hypothesis testing package and runs on
all major versions of operating systems. It also includes novel tests not found in other
packages. It is quick to install and free of charge. If you need to use multivariate
hypothesis testing, be sure to give hyppo a try!"
