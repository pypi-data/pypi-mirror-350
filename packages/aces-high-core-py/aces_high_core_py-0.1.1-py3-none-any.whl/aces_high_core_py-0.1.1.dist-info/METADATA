# Aces High: Core Python Library

A Python library for modeling playing cards, decks, and core logic for traditional card games. Built with clean, testable design principles and designed to serve as the foundation for more complex gameplay logic.

## Features

- 🎴 Card and Deck modeling using Pythonic, enum-safe data structures
- 🔁 Standard shuffling, dealing, and deck state management
- 🧪 Fully tested with `pytest`, using a test-first design process
- 🧹 Enforced code quality via `black` and `ruff`
- 📦 Easy-to-install package, published to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/aces-high-core/)

## Installation

```bash
pip install aces-high-core-py
```

---

## Usage

```python

deck = StandardDeck()
deck.shuffle()

hand = deck.deal(5)
for card in hand:
    print(card)
```
