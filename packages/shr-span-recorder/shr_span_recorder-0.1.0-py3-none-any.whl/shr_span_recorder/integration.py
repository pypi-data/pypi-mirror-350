    #       the Django integration will not be loaded as a default integration.
    #    2) Integrations are deduplicated by identifier in sentry_sdk.setup_integrations(). If
    #       you list both this integration and DjangoIntegration, Sentry will only load the
    #       *last* integration with a duplicate identifier.
    #    3) Disabling DjangoIntegration through sentry_sdk.init(disabled_integrations=...) will
    #       also disable this Integration.
    #    4) A bunch of callbacks check if DjangoIntegration is loaded. If so, they will e.g.
    #       log a DB call. The easiest way to fake that is identifier='django'.
    #    5) Requests for settings on DjangoIntegration will use our Integration instead.
