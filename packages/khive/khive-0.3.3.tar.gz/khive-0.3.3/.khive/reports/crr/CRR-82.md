    """
    Process an entity with the given options.

    Args:
        entity_id: The ID of the entity to process

async def test_token_bucket_with_api_client():
    """Test integration of TokenBucketRateLimiter with AsyncAPIClient."""
    # Arrange
    with patch("time.monotonic") as mock_time:
        # Set up mock time to advance by 0.1 seconds on each call
        mock_time.side_effect = [i * 0.1 for i in range(100)]

        mock_client.get = AsyncMock(return_value={"data": "response"})

        # Mock the acquire method to verify it's called correctly

        acquire_calls = []

        async def mock_acquire(tokens=1.0):
            acquire_calls.append(tokens)
            return await original_acquire(tokens)

        rate_limiter.acquire = mock_acquire

        # Act

        for i in range(10):
            result = await rate_limiter.execute(mock_client.get, f"/endpoint/{i}")

## 8. Detailed Findings

### 8.1 Previous Critical Issues (Now Fixed)

#### Issue 1: Double Shutdown Call in RateLimitedExecutor (FIXED)

**Location:** `src/khive/clients/executor.py:414-424` **Description:** The
`__aexit__` method in RateLimitedExecutor was calling `shutdown()`, which in
turn called `executor.shutdown()`. This resulted in `executor.shutdown()` being
called twice when used as a context manager. **Resolution:** The implementation
has been fixed to avoid the duplicate shutdown call.

#### Issue 2: Endpoint Test Failures (FIXED)

**Location:** `tests/connections/test_endpoint_additional.py`,
`tests/connections/test_endpoint_resource_cleanup.py` **Description:** Several
endpoint-related tests were failing due to issues with how the rate limiter
interacted with the endpoint and API client components. **Resolution:** The
integration issues have been fixed, and all tests are now passing.

### 8.2 Improvements

#### Improvement 1: Enhanced Error Handling in AdaptiveRateLimiter

**Location:** `src/khive/clients/rate_limiter.py:348-439`\
**Description:** The error handling in the AdaptiveRateLimiter's
`update_from_headers` method could be improved to better handle malformed
headers and edge cases.\
**Benefit:** More robust handling of unexpected API responses and better error
reporting.\
**Suggestion:** Add more specific exception handling and validation for header
values.

```python
# Current implementation (simplified)
try:
    limit = int(lower_headers[f"{prefix}limit"])
    remaining = int(lower_headers[f"{prefix}remaining"])
    # ...
except (ValueError, TypeError) as e:
    logger.warning(f"Error parsing rate limit headers: {e}")

# Suggested implementation
try:
    limit_str = lower_headers.get(f"{prefix}limit")
    remaining_str = lower_headers.get(f"{prefix}remaining")

    if not limit_str or not remaining_str:
        logger.warning(f"Missing required rate limit headers: {prefix}limit or {prefix}remaining")
        return

    try:
        limit = int(limit_str)
        remaining = int(remaining_str)

        if limit <= 0:
            logger.warning(f"Invalid rate limit value: {limit}")
            return

        # Continue with processing...
    except ValueError:
        logger.warning(f"Non-numeric rate limit values: limit={limit_str}, remaining={remaining_str}")
        return
except Exception as e:
    logger.warning(f"Unexpected error parsing rate limit headers: {e}")
```

#### Improvement 2: Configurable Safety Margins

**Location:** `src/khive/clients/rate_limiter.py:318-346`\
**Description:** The AdaptiveRateLimiter uses a fixed safety factor, but this
could be made more configurable based on the specific API provider or endpoint.\
**Benefit:** More fine-grained control over rate limiting behavior for different
APIs with different rate limit characteristics.\
**Suggestion:** Add support for provider-specific or endpoint-specific safety
factors.

```python
# Current implementation
def __init__(
    self,
    initial_rate: float,
    initial_period: float = 1.0,
    max_tokens: float | None = None,
    min_rate: float = 1.0,
    safety_factor: float = 0.9,
):
    # ...
    self.safety_factor = safety_factor

# Suggested implementation
def __init__(
    self,
    initial_rate: float,
    initial_period: float = 1.0,
    max_tokens: float | None = None,
    min_rate: float = 1.0,
    safety_factor: float = 0.9,
    provider_safety_factors: Dict[str, float] = None,
):
    # ...
    self.safety_factor = safety_factor
    self.provider_safety_factors = provider_safety_factors or {}

def get_safety_factor(self, provider: str = None) -> float:
    """Get the appropriate safety factor for the given provider."""
    if provider and provider in self.provider_safety_factors:
        return self.provider_safety_factors[provider]
    return self.safety_factor
```

### 8.3 Positive Highlights

#### Highlight 1: Excellent Token Bucket Implementation

**Location:** `src/khive/clients/rate_limiter.py:24-154`\
**Description:** The TokenBucketRateLimiter class is a clean, well-documented
implementation of the token bucket algorithm with proper token tracking and
refill logic.\
**Strength:** The implementation is thread-safe, efficient, and follows best
practices for asynchronous programming. The code is also well-documented with
clear docstrings and examples.

```python
# Example of excellent code
async def _refill(self) -> None:
    """
    Refill tokens based on elapsed time.

    This method calculates the number of tokens to add based on the
    time elapsed since the last refill, and adds them to the bucket
    up to the maximum capacity.
    """
    now = time.monotonic()
    elapsed = now - self.last_refill
    new_tokens = elapsed * (self.rate / self.period)

    if new_tokens > 0:
        self.tokens = min(self.tokens + new_tokens, self.max_tokens)
        self.last_refill = now
        logger.debug(
            f"Refilled {new_tokens:.2f} tokens, current tokens: {self.tokens:.2f}/{self.max_tokens}"
        )
```

#### Highlight 2: Comprehensive Adaptive Rate Limiting

**Location:** `src/khive/clients/rate_limiter.py:297-439`\
**Description:** The AdaptiveRateLimiter class provides a sophisticated
mechanism for adjusting rate limits based on response headers from various API
providers.\
**Strength:** The implementation handles multiple header formats, applies safety
factors, and ensures minimum rates are maintained. This makes the rate limiter
highly adaptable to different API providers and changing rate limit conditions.
