## 4. Code Quality Assessment

### 4.1 Code Structure and Organization

**Strengths:**

- Clear separation of concerns between `BoundedQueue` (core implementation) and
  `WorkQueue` (high-level wrapper)
- Logical organization of methods within classes
- Proper use of private methods and attributes with underscore prefix
- Good use of properties for derived attributes (size, is_full, is_empty, etc.)

**Improvements Needed:**

- Consider moving QueueConfig to a separate file if it might be reused elsewhere
- Minor: Consider using more type annotations for internal variables

### 4.2 Code Style and Consistency

```python
# Example of excellent code style in the implementation
async def put(self, item: T, timeout: float | None = None) -> bool:
    """
    Add an item to the queue with backpressure.

    Args:
        item: The item to enqueue
        timeout: Operation timeout (overrides default)

    Returns:
        True if the item was enqueued, False if backpressure was applied

    Raises:
        QueueStateError: If the queue is not in PROCESSING state
        QueueFullError: If the queue is full and backpressure is applied
    """
    if self._status != QueueStatus.PROCESSING:
        raise QueueStateError(
            f"Cannot put items when queue is {self._status.value}",
            current_state=self._status.value,
        )

    try:
        # Use wait_for to implement backpressure with timeout
        await asyncio.wait_for(
            self.queue.put(item), timeout=timeout or self.timeout
        )
        self._metrics["enqueued"] += 1
        self.logger.debug(f"Item enqueued. Queue size: {self.size}/{self.maxsize}")
        return True
    except asyncio.TimeoutError:
        # Queue is full - apply backpressure
        self._metrics["backpressure_events"] += 1
        self.logger.warning(
            f"Backpressure applied - queue full ({self.size}/{self.maxsize})"
        )
        return False
```

The code consistently follows good Python practices:

- Clear docstrings with Args/Returns/Raises sections
- Proper type annotations
- Consistent error handling
- Good use of logging
- Clear variable naming

### 4.3 Error Handling

**Strengths:**

- Comprehensive error handling in worker tasks
- Custom error handler support for worker errors
- Proper use of specific exceptions with meaningful messages
- Good use of try/except/finally blocks to ensure cleanup

**Improvements Needed:**

- None - all previous suggestions have been addressed

### 4.4 Type Safety

**Strengths:**

- Consistent use of type annotations throughout the code
- Use of Generic[T] for type-safe queue implementation
- Clear return type annotations for all methods
- Proper use of Optional for nullable parameters

**Improvements Needed:**

- Add more specific type annotations for internal variables
- Consider using Protocol classes for callback functions

### 5.3 Test Quality Assessment

**Strengths:**

- Well-structured tests following Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Good use of fixtures and mocks
- Comprehensive test cases covering normal operation and edge cases
- Tests for both unit functionality and integration with other components

**Improvements Needed:**

- Add more tests for concurrent access patterns
- Consider adding stress tests for high-load scenarios

```python
# Example of a well-structured test from the implementation
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_bounded_queue_worker_error_handling(mock_logger):
    """Test that workers handle errors gracefully."""
    # Arrange
    queue = BoundedQueue(maxsize=10, logger=mock_logger)
    await queue.start()

    # Define a worker function that raises an exception for certain items
    async def worker(item):
        if item == "error_item":
            raise ValueError("Test error")

    # Define an error handler
    error_items = []
    async def error_handler(error, item):
        error_items.append((error, item))

    # Start workers with error handler
    await queue.start_workers(worker, num_workers=1, error_handler=error_handler)

    # Act
    # Add items to the queue, including one that will cause an error
    await queue.put("item1")
    await queue.put("error_item")
    await queue.put("item2")

    # Wait for all items to be processed
    await queue.join()

    # Assert
    assert len(error_items) == 1
    error, item = error_items[0]
    assert isinstance(error, ValueError)
    assert str(error) == "Test error"
    assert item == "error_item"

    # Check metrics
    assert queue.metrics["errors"] == 1
    assert queue.metrics["processed"] == 3  # All items should be marked as processed

    # Cleanup
    await queue.stop()
```

### 7.3 Optimization Opportunities

- Consider adding a configurable retry mechanism for failed worker tasks
- Explore adaptive worker pool sizing based on queue depth
- Consider adding metrics collection for performance monitoring

## 8. Detailed Findings

### 8.1 Critical Issues

No critical issues were identified in the implementation.

### 8.2 Improvements

#### Improvement 1: Update Pydantic Validators ✅

**Location:** `src/khive/clients/queue.py:39-57`\
**Description:** The implementation now uses Pydantic V2 style
`@field_validator` decorators.\
**Status:** Addressed in latest commit

```python
# Current implementation
@field_validator("queue_capacity")
def validate_queue_capacity(cls, v):
    """Validate that queue capacity is at least 1."""
    if v < 1:
        raise ValueError("Queue capacity must be at least 1")
    return v
```

#### Improvement 2: Add More Specific Exception Types ✅

**Location:** `src/khive/clients/errors.py`\
**Description:** The implementation now includes specific exception types for
queue-related errors.\
**Status:** Addressed in latest commit

```python
# Implemented exception types
class QueueError(APIClientError):
    """Base exception for all queue-related errors."""

class QueueFullError(QueueError):
    """Exception raised when a queue is full and cannot accept more items."""
    # ...

class QueueEmptyError(QueueError):
    """Exception raised when trying to get an item from an empty queue."""
    # ...

class QueueStateError(QueueError):
    """Exception raised when queue operations are attempted in invalid states."""
    # ...
```

#### Improvement 3: Improved Error Logging ✅

**Location:** `src/khive/clients/queue.py`\
**Description:** The implementation now uses `logger.exception()` for better
error logging with stack traces.\
**Status:** Addressed in latest commit

```python
# Example of improved error logging
try:
    # Process the item
    await worker_func(item)
except Exception as e:
    self._metrics["errors"] += 1

    if error_handler:
        try:
            await error_handler(e, item)
        except Exception:
            self.logger.exception(
                f"Error in error handler. Original error: {e}"
            )
    else:
        self.logger.exception("Error processing item")
```

### 8.3 Positive Highlights

#### Highlight 1: Excellent Backpressure Implementation

**Location:** `src/khive/clients/queue.py:167-198`\
**Description:** The implementation of backpressure in the `put` method is
elegant and effective.\
**Strength:** Uses asyncio.wait_for with a timeout to implement backpressure,
providing a clean way to handle queue overflow without blocking indefinitely.

```python
try:
    # Use wait_for to implement backpressure with timeout
    await asyncio.wait_for(
        self.queue.put(item), timeout=timeout or self.timeout
    )
    self._metrics["enqueued"] += 1
    self.logger.debug(f"Item enqueued. Queue size: {self.size}/{self.maxsize}")
    return True
except asyncio.TimeoutError:
    # Queue is full - apply backpressure
    self._metrics["backpressure_events"] += 1
    self.logger.warning(
        f"Backpressure applied - queue full ({self.size}/{self.maxsize})"
    )
    return False
```

#### Highlight 2: Comprehensive Worker Error Handling

**Location:** `src/khive/clients/queue.py:314-364`\
**Description:** The worker loop implementation has excellent error handling.\
**Strength:** Handles multiple error scenarios including task cancellation,
worker function errors, and error handler errors, ensuring robustness and
preventing worker crashes.

#### Highlight 3: Excellent Test Coverage

**Location:** `tests/clients/test_queue.py` and
`tests/integration/test_queue_integration.py`\
**Description:** The test suite is comprehensive and well-structured.\
**Strength:** Covers both unit functionality and integration with other
components, with excellent coverage of edge cases and error scenarios.
