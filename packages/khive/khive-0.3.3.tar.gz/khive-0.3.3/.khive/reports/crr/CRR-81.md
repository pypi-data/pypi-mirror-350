## 4. Code Quality Assessment

### 4.1 Code Structure and Organization

**Strengths:**

- Clear separation of concerns with each component having a single
  responsibility
- Well-organized module structure following the layered architecture
- Consistent naming conventions and coding style
- Proper use of Python type hints throughout the codebase
- Good use of async/await patterns and context managers

**Improvements Needed:**

- Address linting issues identified by ruff
- Fix shadowing of built-in exception names
- Improve error handling in exception blocks (use `raise ... from e`)
- Store references to asyncio tasks created with `create_task`

### 4.2 Code Style and Consistency

The code generally follows good Python style with clear docstrings, type hints,
and consistent formatting. However, there are some style issues that need to be
addressed:

- Trailing whitespace in several files
- Blank lines containing whitespace
- Unnecessary `elif` statements after `return` or `raise`
- Use of `str(e)` instead of f-string conversion specifiers (`{e!s}`)
- Shadowing of built-in exception names

```python
# Example of good code style
async def execute(
    self,
    func: Callable[..., Awaitable[T]],
    *args: Any,
    **kwargs: Any
) -> T:
    """
    Execute a coroutine with rate limiting.

    Args:
        func: Async function to execute.
        *args: Positional arguments for func.
        **kwargs: Keyword arguments for func.

    Returns:
        Result from func.
    """
    wait_time = await self.acquire()

    if wait_time > 0:
        logger.debug(f"Rate limited: waiting {wait_time:.2f}s before execution")
        await asyncio.sleep(wait_time)

    logger.debug(f"Executing rate-limited function: {func.__name__}")
    return await func(*args, **kwargs)
```

### 4.3 Error Handling

**Strengths:**

- Specific exception types for different error scenarios
- Detailed error messages with context information
- Proper propagation of exceptions with appropriate wrapping
- Good handling of HTTP status codes with specific exceptions

**Improvements Needed:**

- Use `raise ... from e` to preserve exception context
- Use `logging.exception` instead of `logging.error` in exception handlers
- Replace `try-except-pass` with `contextlib.suppress`
- Remove unnecessary `elif` statements after `raise`

### 4.4 Type Safety

**Strengths:**

- Consistent use of type hints throughout the codebase
- Use of generics for better type safety
- Proper use of `TypeVar` for generic functions
- Clear return type annotations

**Improvements Needed:**

- Update deprecated typing imports (e.g., `Dict`, `List`, `Tuple`)
- Use `X | Y` syntax for union types instead of `Optional[X]`
- Use `dict` instead of `Dict` for type annotations

## 5. Test Coverage Analysis

### 5.1 Unit Test Coverage

| Module            | Line Coverage | Branch Coverage | Notes                               |
| ----------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `api_client.py`   | 78%           | N/A             | Good coverage of main functionality |
| `rate_limiter.py` | 100%          | N/A             | Excellent coverage                  |
| `executor.py`     | 94%           | N/A             | Very good coverage                  |
| `resilience.py`   | 100%          | N/A             | Excellent coverage                  |
| `errors.py`       | 100%          | N/A             | Excellent coverage                  |
| `protocols.py`    | 60%           | N/A             | Protocol definitions only           |

## 8. Detailed Findings

### 8.1 Critical Issues

None identified. The implementation is solid and meets all requirements.

### 8.2 Improvements

#### Improvement 1: Fix Linting Issues

**Description:** Several linting issues were identified by ruff, including
trailing whitespace, blank lines with whitespace, and unnecessary `elif`
statements after `return` or `raise`.

**Benefit:** Improved code quality and consistency.

**Suggestion:** Run `ruff --fix` to automatically fix many of these issues, and
manually address the remaining ones.

#### Improvement 2: Fix Exception Handling

**Description:** Exception handling could be improved by using
`raise ... from e` to preserve exception context and using `logging.exception`
instead of `logging.error` in exception handlers.

**Benefit:** Better error tracing and debugging.

**Suggestion:** Update exception handling patterns throughout the codebase.

```python
# Current implementation
except httpx.ConnectError as e:
    logger.error(f"Connection error: {str(e)}")
    raise ConnectionError(f"Connection error: {str(e)}")

# Suggested implementation
except httpx.ConnectError as e:
    logger.exception(f"Connection error")
    raise ConnectionError(f"Connection error: {e!s}") from e
```

#### Improvement 3: Fix Type Annotations

**Description:** Some type annotations use deprecated syntax from the typing
module.

**Benefit:** More modern and maintainable code.

**Suggestion:** Update type annotations to use newer syntax.

```python
# Current implementation
headers: Optional[Dict[str, str]] = None

# Suggested implementation
headers: dict[str, str] | None = None
```

#### Improvement 4: Fix Built-in Shadowing

**Description:** Some exception classes shadow built-in Python exceptions
(`ConnectionError`, `TimeoutError`).

**Benefit:** Avoid confusion and potential bugs.

**Suggestion:** Rename these classes to avoid shadowing.

```python
# Current implementation
class ConnectionError(APIClientError):
    """Exception raised when a connection error occurs."""
    pass

# Suggested implementation
class APIConnectionError(APIClientError):
    """Exception raised when a connection error occurs."""
    pass
```

### 8.3 Positive Highlights

#### Highlight 1: Excellent Resource Management

**Location:** `src/khive/clients/api_client.py`

**Description:** The AsyncAPIClient implements proper resource management with
async context managers, ensuring that resources are properly cleaned up even in
the face of exceptions.

**Strength:** This prevents resource leaks and ensures that the client behaves
correctly in all scenarios.

```python
async def __aenter__(self) -> 'AsyncAPIClient':
    """
    Enter the async context manager.

    Returns:
        The AsyncAPIClient instance.
    """
    await self._get_client()
    return self

async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb) -> None:
    """
    Exit the async context manager and release resources.

    Args:
        exc_type: The exception type, if an exception was raised.
        exc_val: The exception value, if an exception was raised.
        exc_tb: The exception traceback, if an exception was raised.
    """
    await self.close()
```

#### Highlight 2: Well-Implemented Token Bucket Algorithm

**Location:** `src/khive/clients/rate_limiter.py`

**Description:** The TokenBucketRateLimiter implements the token bucket
algorithm correctly, allowing for controlled bursts of requests while
maintaining a long-term rate limit.

**Strength:** This provides effective rate limiting with good performance
characteristics.

```python
async def acquire(self, tokens: float = 1.0) -> float:
    """
    Acquire tokens from the bucket.

    Args:
        tokens: Number of tokens to acquire.

    Returns:
        Wait time in seconds before tokens are available.
        Returns 0.0 if tokens are immediately available.
    """
    async with self._lock:
        await self._refill()

        if self.tokens >= tokens:
            self.tokens -= tokens
            logger.debug(f"Acquired {tokens} tokens, remaining: {self.tokens:.2f}")
            return 0.0

        # Calculate wait time until enough tokens are available
        deficit = tokens - self.tokens
        wait_time = deficit * self.period / self.rate

        logger.debug(
            f"Not enough tokens (requested: {tokens}, available: {self.tokens:.2f}), "
            f"wait time: {wait_time:.2f}s"
        )

        return wait_time
```

#### Highlight 3: Comprehensive Test Suite

**Location:** `tests/clients/`

**Description:** The test suite is comprehensive, covering all components and
their interactions, with both unit and integration tests.

**Strength:** This ensures that the code works correctly and will continue to
work correctly as it evolves.
