# Implementation Plan: Fix Neo4j Adapter Tests

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Component Purpose

Fix the failing tests in `tests/test_neo4j_adapter_extended.py` that are related
to mocking the context manager protocol for Neo4j's session method.

### 1.2 Design Reference

PR #24 is implementing test coverage for various adapters, and we needed to fix
the failing Neo4j adapter tests to ensure proper test coverage.

### 1.3 Implementation Approach

The issue was that the current mocking approach didn't properly simulate the
context manager protocol. We modified the test mocks to correctly handle the
`with driver.session() as s:` statement used in the `Neo4jAdapter`
implementation.

## 2. Implementation Phases

### 2.1 Phase 1: Fix Mock Setup

**Key Deliverables:**

- Updated the mock setup in the failing tests to properly simulate the context
  manager protocol

**Dependencies:**

- Understanding of Python's context manager protocol
- Understanding of unittest.mock's capabilities for mocking context managers

**Estimated Complexity:** Low

## 3. Test Strategy

The tests themselves were what we fixed, so our strategy was to ensure they pass
correctly and verify the expected behavior of the `Neo4jAdapter` class.

## 4. Implementation Tasks

### 4.1 Fix Mock Setup

| ID  | Task                             | Description                                              | Dependencies | Priority | Complexity |
| --- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | -------- | ---------- |
| T-1 | Research context manager mocking | Understand how to properly mock context managers         | None         | High     | Low        |
| T-2 | Update test mocks                | Modify the mock setup in the failing tests               | T-1          | High     | Low        |
| T-3 | Verify tests pass                | Run the tests to ensure they pass with the updated mocks | T-2          | High     | Low        |

## 5. Implementation Sequence

1. Research proper context manager mocking
2. Update the test mocks in all failing tests
3. Run the tests to verify they pass

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

| ID   | Criterion                                        | Validation Method               |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| AC-1 | All tests in test_neo4j_adapter_extended.py pass | Run pytest on the specific file |
| AC-2 | No regressions in other tests                    | Run the full test suite         |

## 7. Implementation Details

The key issue was that when mocking a context manager (like the session in
Neo4j), we need to properly set up the mock to handle the context manager
protocol. In the Neo4j adapter, we're using a context manager with
`with driver.session() as s:`, but our mocks in the tests weren't properly
configured to handle this.

The fix was to change:

```python
mock_graph_db.driver.return_value.session.return_value = mock_session
```

To:

```python
mock_graph_db.driver.return_value.session.return_value.__enter__.return_value = mock_session
```

This properly mocks the context manager protocol, ensuring that when the code
executes `with driver.session() as s:`, the `s` variable is correctly set to our
mock_session.

## 8. Search Evidence

- Search: pplx-1 - "python mock context manager" - Found information about
  properly mocking context managers and ensuring the mock returns an object that
  supports `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods (or `__aenter__` and `__aexit__`
  for async context managers).
