# Implementation Plan: Open Source Ready Documentation

## 1. Overview

This implementation plan outlines the necessary documentation updates to make
the khive project "open source ready." The focus is on ensuring all
documentation is clear, consistent, accurate, and accessible to new users and
external contributors.

## 2. Scope

The scope of this implementation plan includes:

1. Updates to README.md
2. Updates to LICENSE
3. Updates to CHANGELOG.md
4. Review and updates to files in the docs/ directory

## 3. Identified Issues

### 3.1 README.md Issues

- Command inconsistency: References to `khive search` instead of the current
  `khive info search`
- API key information placement: Currently in a non-prominent location
- Project layout section: Lists individual Python files instead of describing
  directory structure at a higher level
- Lack of clarity on `khive info` vs. `khive search`

### 3.2 LICENSE Issues

- Copyright notice needs updating from "Copyright 2024 HaiyangLi" to reflect the
  project/organization and current year
