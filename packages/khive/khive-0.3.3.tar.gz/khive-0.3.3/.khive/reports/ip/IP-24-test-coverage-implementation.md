# Implementation Plan: Fix Async SQL Adapter Tests

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Component Purpose

Fix the failing tests in `tests/test_async_sql_adapter_extended.py` that are
related to mocking the async context manager protocol for SQLAlchemy's
engine.begin() method.

### 1.2 Design Reference

PR #24 is implementing test coverage for the async adapters, and we need to fix
the failing tests to ensure proper test coverage.

### 1.3 Implementation Approach

The issue is that the current mocking approach doesn't properly simulate the
async context manager protocol. We need to modify the test mocks to correctly
handle the `async with` statement used in the `AsyncSQLAdapter` implementation.

## 2. Implementation Phases

### 2.1 Phase 1: Fix Mock Setup

**Key Deliverables:**

- Update the mock setup in the failing tests to properly simulate the async
  context manager protocol

**Dependencies:**

- Understanding of Python's async context manager protocol
- Understanding of unittest.mock's AsyncMock capabilities

**Estimated Complexity:** Medium

## 3. Test Strategy

The tests themselves are what we're fixing, so our strategy is to ensure they
pass correctly and verify the expected behavior of the `AsyncSQLAdapter` class.

## 4. Implementation Tasks

### 4.1 Fix Mock Setup

| ID  | Task                                   | Description                                                           | Dependencies | Priority | Complexity |
| --- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | -------- | ---------- |
| T-1 | Research async context manager mocking | Understand how to properly mock async context managers with AsyncMock | None         | High     | Low        |
| T-2 | Update test mocks                      | Modify the mock setup in the failing tests                            | T-1          | High     | Medium     |
| T-3 | Verify tests pass                      | Run the tests to ensure they pass with the updated mocks              | T-2          | High     | Low        |

## 5. Implementation Sequence

1. Research proper async context manager mocking
2. Update the test mocks in all failing tests
3. Run the tests to verify they pass

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

| ID   | Criterion                                            | Validation Method               |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| AC-1 | All tests in test_async_sql_adapter_extended.py pass | Run pytest on the specific file |
| AC-2 | No regressions in other tests                        | Run the full test suite         |

## 7. Implementation Risks and Mitigations

| Risk                                   | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation                                       |
| -------------------------------------- | ------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Changes might affect other async tests | Medium | Low        | Run the full test suite to ensure no regressions |

## 8. Additional Resources

### 8.1 Reference Implementation

- [Python AsyncMock documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.AsyncMock)
- [Python Async Context Manager Protocol](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#asynchronous-context-managers)

### 8.2 Search Evidence

- Search: pplx-1 - "python mock async context manager" - Found information about
  properly mocking async context managers using AsyncMock and ensuring the mock
  returns an object that supports **aenter** and **aexit** methods.
