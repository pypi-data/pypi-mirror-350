# Implementation Plan: Standardize Async Resource Cleanup Patterns

## 1. Overview

This implementation plan outlines the approach to standardize async resource
cleanup patterns in `src/khive/connections/endpoint.py` and across provider
implementations, aligning with the technical design specification in TDS-80.md.
The goal is to ensure consistent and reliable resource management for
asynchronous operations, particularly focusing on proper cleanup of client
connections and other resources.

## 2. Requirements

Based on Issue #85 and the technical design specification (TDS-80.md), the
requirements are:

1. Standardize async resource cleanup patterns in
   `src/khive/connections/endpoint.py`
2. Ensure consistent resource cleanup across provider implementations
3. Implement proper async context manager support for all relevant components
4. Ensure all new code includes tests with >80% coverage
5. Document the implementation approach and patterns

## 3. Dependencies

- Issue #80: Technical Design Specification for async resource cleanup patterns
- Issue #81 (merged PR #88): Previous implementation that needs to be aligned
  with

## 4. Implementation Approach

### 4.1 Define AsyncResourceManager Protocol

Create a standardized protocol for async resource management that all relevant
components will implement:

```python
class AsyncResourceManager(Protocol):
    """Protocol for components that manage async resources with context managers."""

    async def __aenter__(self) -> "AsyncResourceManager":
        """Enter the async context manager."""
        ...

    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb) -> None:
        """Exit the async context manager and release resources."""
        ...
```

### 4.2 Update Existing Protocols

Update the `ResourceClient` and `Executor` protocols to extend the
`AsyncResourceManager` protocol:

```python
class ResourceClient(AsyncResourceManager, Protocol):
    """Protocol for resource clients that interact with external APIs."""
    # Existing methods...

class Executor(AsyncResourceManager, Protocol):
    """Protocol for executors that manage concurrent operations."""
    # Existing methods...
```

### 4.3 Enhance Endpoint Class

Improve the `Endpoint` class to properly implement the async context manager
protocol:

1. Enhance `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` methods with proper documentation
2. Add a robust `_close_client` method to handle different client types
3. Ensure proper error handling during resource cleanup
4. Clear client references after cleanup to prevent resource leaks

### 4.4 Update Executor Classes

Update the `AsyncExecutor` and `RateLimitedExecutor` classes to implement the
async context manager protocol:

1. Add `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` methods to both classes
2. Ensure proper resource cleanup in the `__aexit__` method
3. Update documentation to recommend using the async context manager pattern

## 5. Testing Strategy

### 5.1 Unit Tests

Create comprehensive unit tests for the updated components:

1. Test `Endpoint` class async context manager methods
2. Test `AsyncExecutor` and `RateLimitedExecutor` async context manager methods
3. Test error handling during resource cleanup
4. Test with different client types (HTTP and SDK clients)

### 5.2 Integration Tests

Create integration tests to verify that components work together properly:

1. Test `Endpoint` with `AsyncExecutor`
2. Test `Endpoint` with `RateLimitedExecutor`
3. Test multiple endpoints with a single executor
4. Test resource cleanup under load
5. Test for resource leaks

## 6. Implementation Steps

1. Update `protocols.py` to add the `AsyncResourceManager` protocol and update
   existing protocols
2. Enhance the `Endpoint` class with improved async context manager support
3. Update the `AsyncExecutor` and `RateLimitedExecutor` classes with async
   context manager support
4. Create unit tests for the updated components
5. Create integration tests for the components working together
6. Run tests to verify implementation
7. Document the implementation and patterns

## 7. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk                                          | Mitigation                                                                           |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Breaking changes to existing code             | Ensure backward compatibility by maintaining existing methods alongside new patterns |
| Resource leaks                                | Implement comprehensive tests to verify proper resource cleanup                      |
| Inconsistent implementation across components | Use a standardized protocol to ensure consistency                                    |
| Error handling during cleanup                 | Implement robust error handling to ensure resources are always released              |
