# Implementation Plan: Fix URL Sanitization Security Issues in test_khive_info.py

## 1. Overview

This implementation plan addresses two code scanning security issues identified
in `tests/cli/test_khive_info.py` related to incomplete URL substring
sanitization. The issues are in the
`test_parse_key_value_options_complex_values` function where the test is
checking parsing of domain lists.

## 2. Current Issues

1. Line 132: The string "example.com" may be at an arbitrary position in the
   sanitized URL.
2. Line 133: The string "test.org" may be at an arbitrary position in the
   sanitized URL.

The current implementation is vulnerable to URL substring sanitization bypasses.
For example, a malicious URL like "malicious-example.com" would pass the current
check because it contains "example.com" as a substring.

## 3. Proposed Solution

### 3.1 Approach

1. Modify the test to use proper URL validation by checking for exact domain
   matches rather than substring matches.
2. Use `urllib.parse.urlparse` to properly parse URLs and extract hostnames.
3. Implement a helper function to validate domains properly.
4. Update the test to use this helper function.

### 3.2 Implementation Details

#### 3.2.1 Create a Domain Validation Helper

Create a helper function that:

1. Takes a list of expected domains and a list of actual domains
2. Properly validates that each actual domain exactly matches one of the
   expected domains
3. Uses `urllib.parse.urlparse` to extract hostnames from URLs if needed

#### 3.2.2 Update the Test

Modify `test_parse_key_value_options_complex_values` to:

1. Use the new helper function to validate domains
2. Ensure exact domain matching rather than substring matching
3. Maintain the existing functionality of testing JSON parsing

## 4. Test Plan

1. Update the existing test to use proper domain validation
2. Add additional test cases to verify that the fix prevents URL substring
   sanitization bypasses:
   - Test with exact domain matches (should pass)
   - Test with subdomains (should fail unless explicitly allowed)
   - Test with malicious domains containing the allowed domains as substrings
     (should fail)

## 5. Implementation Steps

1. Create a domain validation helper function in the test file
2. Update the `test_parse_key_value_options_complex_values` function to use this
   helper
3. Add additional test cases to verify the fix
4. Run the tests to ensure they pass

## 6. Security Considerations

- The fix should prevent URL substring sanitization bypasses
- The fix should properly handle various URL formats
- The fix should be robust against common URL manipulation techniques

## 8. Implementation Timeline

- Implementation: 1 hour
- Testing: 30 minutes
- Documentation: 30 minutes
- Total: 2 hours

## 9. Conclusion

This implementation plan addresses the security issues identified in the test
file by implementing proper URL validation. The fix will ensure that domain
checks are done correctly using `urlparse` from the `urllib.parse` module,
preventing URL substring sanitization bypasses.
