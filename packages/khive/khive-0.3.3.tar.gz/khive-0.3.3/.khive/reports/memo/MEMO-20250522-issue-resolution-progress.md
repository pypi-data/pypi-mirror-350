# Khive Issue Resolution Progress & Next Steps - 2025-05-22

## Summary of Progress

This session focused on processing open GitHub issues for the `khive-ai/khive.d`
repository. Significant progress was made in moving several key initiatives
forward through research, design, and implementation task delegation.

## Detailed Issue Status

- **PR #101 (API Calling/Rate Limiting Infra):**
  - Status: Assigned to `@khive-reviewer` for review.
  - Next Step: Await review feedback.
- **Issue #100 (Architectural Refactor to `lionfuncs`):**
  - Status: `TDS-100.md` (detailing migration to `lionfuncs`) created by
    `@khive-architect`. PR #108 created and assigned to `@khive-reviewer`.
  - Next Step: Await review of `TDS-100.md`.
- **Issue #109 (Improve `khive pr` error messaging):**
  - Status: New issue created based on user feedback.
  - Next Step: Prioritize for research/design then implementation.
- **Issue #86 (Async Testing Infrastructure):**
  - Status: `RR-86.md` (researching async testing best practices) created by
    `@khive-researcher`. PR #111 created and assigned to `@khive-reviewer`.
  - Next Step: Await review of `RR-86.md`. Design task for `@khive-architect` to
    follow.
- **Issue #80 (Layered Resource Control Architecture):**
  - Status: `TDS-80.md` (detailing architecture leveraging `lionfuncs`) created
    by `@khive-architect`. PR #112 created and assigned to `@khive-reviewer`.
  - Next Step: Await review of `TDS-80.md`.
- **Issue #30 (Reader Microservice Documentation):**
  - Status: Documentation created by `@khive-documenter`. PR #114 created and
    assigned to `@khive-reviewer`.
  - Next Step: Await review of documentation.
- **Issue #29 (Reader Observability):**
  - Status: Implementation by `@khive-implementer` complete. PR #115 created and
    assigned to `@khive-reviewer`.
  - Next Step: Await review of implementation.
- **Issue #28 (Implement `khive reader search`):**
  - Status: Implementation by `@khive-implementer` complete. PR #116 created and
    assigned to `@khive-reviewer`.
  - Next Step: Await review of implementation.
- **Issue #27 (Reader Processing Pipeline - `docling` decision):**
  - Status: Implementation paused by `@khive-implementer` pending decision on
    `docling`. `RR-27-docling.md` (researching `docling`) created by
    `@khive-researcher`. PR #118 created and assigned to `@khive-reviewer`.
  - Next Step: Await review of `RR-27-docling.md` to make a decision on text
    extraction library. Then, `@khive-implementer` can resume.
- **Issue #26 (Implement `khive reader ingest` - `pydapter` redesign):**
  - Status: Implementation paused by `@khive-implementer` due to new `pydapter`
    requirement. `TDS-26-pydapter-ingestion.md` (redesigning ingestion with
    `pydapter`) created by `@khive-architect`. PR #119 created and assigned to
    `@khive-reviewer`.
  - Next Step: Await review of `TDS-26-pydapter-ingestion.md`. This will unblock
    implementation.
- **Issue #25 (Bootstrap persistence with Pydapter):**
  - Status: Marked as dependent on PR #119 (`TDS-26-pydapter-ingestion.md`).
  - Next Step: Implementation will follow the approved design from
    `TDS-26-pydapter-ingestion.md`.
- **Issue #24 (Define Reader domain models):**
  - Status: Marked as dependent on PR #119 (`TDS-26-pydapter-ingestion.md`).
  - Next Step: Implementation will follow the approved design from
    `TDS-26-pydapter-ingestion.md`.
- **Issue #23 (Add Pydapter core & pgvector plugin):**
  - Status: Marked as dependent on PR #119 (`TDS-26-pydapter-ingestion.md`).
  - Next Step: Implementation will follow the approved design from
    `TDS-26-pydapter-ingestion.md`.
- **Issue #103 (Improve `khive new-doc` error messages):**
  - Status: Implementation by `@khive-implementer` complete. PR #120 created and
    assigned to `@khive-reviewer`.
  - Next Step: Await review of implementation.
- **Issue #104 (Modify prompt for `khive fmt/ci` enforcement):**
  - Status: `RR-104.md` (researching CI/prompt enhancements) created by
    `@khive-researcher`. PR #121 created. (Self-correction: I will assign this
    PR for review next).
  - Next Step: Assign PR #121 for review. Design task for `@khive-architect` to
    follow.

## Merged PRs (Documentation/Reports)

- PR #108 (`TDS-100.md`)
- PR #111 (`RR-86.md`)
- PR #112 (`TDS-80.md`)
- PR #114 (Reader Docs - Issue #30)
- Associated branches cleaned.

## Next Steps & Priorities

1. **Review Cycle:** Monitor and facilitate reviews for all outstanding PRs:
   - PR #101 (API Calling Infra)
   - PR #108 (TDS for lionfuncs migration)
   - PR #111 (RR for async testing)
   - PR #112 (TDS for resource control arch)
   - PR #114 (Reader Docs)
   - PR #115 (Reader Observability Impl)
   - PR #116 (Reader Search Impl)
   - PR #118 (RR for docling)
   - PR #119 (TDS for pydapter ingestion)
   - PR #120 (new-doc error messages Impl)
   - PR #121 (RR for CI/prompt enhancements)
2. **Unblock Key Issues:**
   - **Issue #27 (Reader Processing):** Make a decision on `docling` vs.
     individual parsers based on `RR-27-docling.md` review. Then,
     `@khive-implementer` can resume.
   - **Issue #26, #25, #24, #23 (Reader Ingestion & Persistence):** Once
     `TDS-26-pydapter-ingestion.md` (PR #119) is approved, delegate
     implementation tasks to `@khive-implementer`.
3. **Continue Processing Remaining Issues:** Once reviews are complete and
   blockers are resolved, proceed with the next set of open issues:
   - Issue #105: "add `khive review`"
   - Issue #106: "add `project manager` cli, mode or service"
   - Issue #107: "more templates"
   - And any new issues arising from reviews or further planning.
4. **Follow up on Design Tasks:** After research reports (RR-86, RR-104) are
   approved, delegate design tasks (TDS) to `@khive-architect`.

This memo will serve as a reference for our continued efforts.
