# Welcome to StepUp Queue

StepUp Queue is an experimental extension of
[StepUp Core](https://reproducible-reporting.github.io/stepup-core)
to integrate queued jobs into a workflow.
Currently, it only supports integration with [SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com/),
but it is designed to be extensible to other job schedulers.
