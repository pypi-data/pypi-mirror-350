00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,755
Hello everyone! Last week we saw how to buy your domains

2
00:00:04,756 --> 00:00:09,574
from Cursor using Fewsats' MCP and

3
00:00:09,575 --> 00:00:13,295
this week we are going to see how to buy anything from Cursor using

4
00:00:13,296 --> 00:00:16,025
our Shopping MCP In order to solve,

5
00:00:16,026 --> 00:00:19,906
first we need to set up two MCPs The first one is Fewsats',

6
00:00:19,907 --> 00:00:23,606
that we saw already last week This is the one where our money is,

7
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:26,383
and it's able to to pay for offers, and the new one for this

8
00:00:26,384 --> 00:00:31,064
week is Agora MCP This will provide us a shopping experience in

9
00:00:31,065 --> 00:00:35,726
Cursor or any MCP client The

10
00:00:35,727 --> 00:00:39,673
first thing that we'll do is, yesterday everyone was getting pictures of a Studio

11
00:00:39,674 --> 00:00:52,596
Ghibli, so let's search for something like that So,

12
00:00:52,597 --> 00:00:55,932
let's see what we have here, Spirited Away pencils,

13
00:00:57,522 --> 00:00:59,824
Princess Mononoke, I like the Princess Mononoke,

14
00:00:59,825 --> 00:01:04,675
so, nah, let's get the postcards Get me the postcards

15
00:01:07,235 --> 00:01:10,470
What this will do is use the Agora MCP in order to get the

16
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:12,909
details of this purchase and get a postcard payment offer.

17
00:01:13,212 --> 00:01:18,504
Once we have the payment offer, it will delegate into Fewsats MCP so

18
00:01:18,505 --> 00:01:23,451
it can pay the offer. So,

19
00:01:23,452 --> 00:01:28,027
it's asking for my user so I will give the user information now.

20
00:01:29,274 --> 00:01:31,730
so now when the information is provided.

21
00:01:31,731 --> 00:01:35,211
It will handle all the rest of the payment.

22
00:01:35,212 --> 00:01:37,919
It will get the payment offers, and after that,

23
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,493
it will delegate into Fewsats, because Fewsats knows how to pay for one of

24
00:01:42,494 --> 00:01:46,283
these offers. MCP has a small bug here that you can see,

25
00:01:46,284 --> 00:01:50,484
but the agent is clever enough to fix it. I hope MCP developers can

26
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:54,653
fix it too. So, we can see it got the payment offers,

27
00:01:54,654 --> 00:01:56,981
and then it called the pay offer,

28
00:01:57,208 --> 00:02:00,392
and now we see that the payment status actually is need review.

29
00:02:00,951 --> 00:02:04,860
Why is that? Because we do not completely trial the AI yet at Fewsats.

30
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,131
So, what we have is policies.

31
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:11,275
So, any API key that you use to pay can have different policies.

32
00:02:11,276 --> 00:02:15,092
In my case, everything that an AI agent has to buy needs to be

33
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:18,775
approved by me, and as the MCP indicates,

34
00:02:18,776 --> 00:02:21,064
you need to go to the website, to approve the request.

35
00:02:21,317 --> 00:02:24,032
So, here you have the website, and if we refresh,

36
00:02:24,033 --> 00:02:26,181
we will see that there is a new request,

37
00:02:26,182 --> 00:02:28,547
and that the status is pending. So,

38
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:31,982
now I can go here, approve, and the payment went through.

39
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,880
And what is the cool thing about MCPs? Here,

40
00:02:34,881 --> 00:02:37,807
we are using cursor, but MCPs can use,

41
00:02:37,808 --> 00:02:41,161
be used for different, from very different clients.

42
00:02:41,447 --> 00:02:45,357
For example, open AI today announced that they will support also MCP.

43
00:02:45,504 --> 00:02:48,107
It's not yet available, but what we can do is,

44
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,436
we can now go to Claude, instead of cursor,

45
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:52,686
and say, hey, Claude,

46
00:02:52,687 --> 00:02:54,803
can you check my latest orders?

47
00:02:56,113 --> 00:02:59,973
And because the MCP is the same, it will be able to retrieve the

48
00:02:59,974 --> 00:03:04,979
information. And

49
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,980
here you see, StudioGhibli,

50
00:03:07,981 --> 00:03:11,078
quantity, status, paid. And that's it.

51
00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:15,940
The cool thing about MCP clients is that now I'm buying it from cursor,

52
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:19,298
now I'm buying it from Claude. Next week I will be able to use

53
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:23,904
it also from ChatGPT, and hopefully very soon we will have someone write

54
00:03:24,095 --> 00:03:28,862
an MCP client for mobile phone. So all these interfaces will

55
00:03:29,202 --> 00:03:31,421
go to the same MCP.

56
00:03:31,697 --> 00:03:34,872
And then, And you will have a seamless experience across all your devices.

57
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:38,312
That was everything from this week, and stay tuned for more.
