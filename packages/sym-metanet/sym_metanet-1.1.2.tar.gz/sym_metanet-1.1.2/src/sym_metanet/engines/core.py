        The available engines in the form of a `dict` whose keys are the available
        engine class types, and the values are info on each engine, such as module and
        class name.

    Parameters
    ----------
    engine : str or instance of engine
        If a string, then `engine` must represent the class name of one of the available
        engines, so that it can be instantiated with args and kwargs (see
        `sym_metanet.engines.get_available_engines`). Otherwise, it must be an instance
        of an engine itself that inherits from `sym_metanet.engines.EngineBase`.
    args, kwargs
        Passed to the engine constructor in case `engine` is a string.

    Returns
    -------
    EngineBase
        A reference to the new engine, if `engine` is a string, or the reference to the
        same instance, otherwise.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        Raises in case `engine` is neither a string nor a `EngineBase` instance.
    EngineNotFoundError
        Raises in case `engine` is a string but matches no available engines.
