**sym-metanet** is a Python package to model traffic networks with the METANET framework, a collection of tools to mathematically model the macroscopic behaviour of traffic in highway systems (see [[1]](#1) and [[2]](#2) for more details).

## Installation

To install the package, run

```bash
pip install sym-metanet
```

**sym-metanet** has the following dependencies

- Python 3.8 or higher
- [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/)

and optionally

- [NumPy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)
- [CasADi](https://pypi.org/project/casadi/).

For playing around with the source code instead, run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FilippoAiraldi/sym-metanet.git
```

## Usage

In METANET, a highway network is represented as a directed graph whose edges are stretches of highways, a.k.a. links. Each link bridges between nodes (that have no physical meaning), which in turn can host origins (sources of traffic flow) and destinations (sinks of flow). For instance, to create a very simple network consisting of a single link connecting an origin to a destination, we can do as follows:

```python
import sym_metanet as metanet

...

N1 = metanet.Node(name="N1")
N2 = metanet.Node(name="N2")
L1 = metanet.Link(segments, lanes, L, rho_max, rho_crit, v_free, a, name="L1")
O1 = metanet.Origin(C[0], name="O1")
D3 = metanet.Destination(name="D3")

net = metanet.Network().add_path(origin=O1, path=(N1, L1, N2, L2, N3), destination=D3)
```

Once the network is built, we can validate it and use, e.g., [CasADi](https://pypi.org/project/casadi/), to symbolically construct a function that represents the dynamics governing this network (according to METANET).

```python
net.is_valid(raises=True)

T = 10 / 3600  # sampling time
metanet.engines.use("casadi", sym_type="SX")
F = metanet.engine.to_function(net=net, T=T)
```

Function `F` can be then used to simulate the state transitions of the network in the context of, e.g., highway traffic control (see [[2]](#2) for more details).

## Examples

Our [examples](examples) folder contains an example on how to get started with this package.

## Extensions

This code is symbolic-engine-agnostic, in the sense that it does not rely on a particular implementation of the underlying engine for symbolic computations. In other words, it is relatively easy to create a new engine for modelling networks with a new specific symbolic library (e.g., [SimPy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html)) by implementing the abstract class [`sym_metanet.engines.core.EngineBase`](src\sym_metanet\engines\core.py#EngineBase). An engine implemented in [CasADi](https://pypi.org/project/casadi/) is already shipped but requires the symbolic library to be installed. Additionally, the engine is also implemented in [NumPy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/) (does not allow symbolic computations though).
