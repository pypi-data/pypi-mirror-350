## ü§ñ Supported Models

- `gpt-4o-mini` (default) - 128K context window, faster and cheaper
- `gpt-4o` - 128K context window
- `gpt-4-turbo` - 128K context window
- `gpt-4` - 8K context window
- `gpt-3.5-turbo` - 16K context window

**Note**: When using time-based enrichment (`just enrich-days`), large diffs may exceed model context limits. For very large diffs, reduce the time period or use staged changes instead.

## üêõ Debug Logging

To enable maximum verbose debug logging for troubleshooting:

```bash
export AUTODOC_LOG_LEVEL="DEBUG"
```

This will enable the most verbose output for:
- All autodoc_ai components with full details
- CrewAI agent execution steps with complete traces
- LiteLLM API calls with request/response details
- Git diff processing with full content preview
- Task execution callbacks with complete output
- Agent reasoning and decision-making process
- Step-by-step execution flow
- Complete API payloads and responses

Additional debug features in DEBUG mode:
- Timestamps and file paths in logs
- Extended agent iterations (10 vs 5)
- Full task and agent object details
- Complete diff content (first 1000 chars)

**Warning**: Debug mode generates VERY extensive output. Use it only when troubleshooting complex issues or understanding the AI's decision process.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- **Missing API Key:**
  - If `OPENAI_API_KEY` is not set, AI features will be disabled and you'll see a warning or the program will exit gracefully.
- **Permission Errors:**
  - Ensure your user has read/write access to the configured files and directories.
- **Unexpected Output?**
  - Double-check your environment variables and config file paths.
- **CrewAI Callback Errors:**
  - If you encounter issues with CrewAI callbacks returning None or causing errors, set `AUTODOC_DISABLE_CALLBACKS="true"` to disable them temporarily.
  - This disables step-by-step execution tracking but allows the crews to complete successfully.
- **Bash Command Issues:**
  - If you encounter issues with the new Bash commands, ensure they are formatted correctly and match the expected patterns.
  - Verify that your environment is set up to support these Bash commands.
