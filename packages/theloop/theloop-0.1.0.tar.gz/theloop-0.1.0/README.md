## Features

- üöÄ Upload files directly from URLs to cloud storage
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Google Cloud Storage support
- üì¶ Streaming uploads with progress tracking
- ‚öôÔ∏è Configurable settings and logging
- üîß Extensible architecture for additional cloud providers
- üõ°Ô∏è Async/await for efficient stream processing

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Google Cloud Storage credentials (for GCP uploads)

### Install from PyPI

```bash
pip install theloop
```

### Install from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/matterai/theloop.git
cd theloop
pip install -e .
```

### Development Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/matterai/theloop.git
cd theloop
uv pip install -e .
uv pip install pytest pytest-cov pytest-asyncio
```

## Usage

### Basic Upload

Upload a file from a URL to Google Cloud Storage:

```bash
theloop upload "https://example.com/file.pdf" "my-bucket" "uploads/file.pdf"
```

### Advanced Usage

#### Using Service Account Credentials

```bash
theloop upload \
  "https://example.com/file.pdf" \
  "my-bucket" \
  "uploads/file.pdf" \
  --credentials ~/path/to/service-account.json \
  --project my-gcp-project-id
```

#### Specify Cloud Provider

```bash
theloop upload \
  "https://example.com/file.pdf" \
  "my-bucket" \
  "uploads/file.pdf" \
  --provider gcp
```

### Configuration

View current settings:

```bash
theloop settings
```

Settings are stored in `~/.theloop/settings.json` and include:
- Logging configuration
- Chunk size for uploads
- Default cloud provider settings

### Authentication

#### Google Cloud Platform

1. **Application Default Credentials** (recommended for local development):
   ```bash
   gcloud auth application-default login
   ```

2. **Service Account Key**:
   ```bash
   theloop upload <url> <bucket> <path> --credentials /path/to/service-account.json
   ```

3. **Environment Variable**:
   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/service-account.json"
   theloop upload <url> <bucket> <path>
   ```

## Development

### Project Structure

```
src/theloop/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cli.py                 # CLI interface using Typer
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ interfaces.py          # Protocol definitions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ services/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config_manager.py  # Settings management
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gcp_uploader.py    # GCP-specific upload logic
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ logging_configurator.py
```

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/matterai/theloop.git
   cd theloop
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   uv pip install -e .
   uv pip install pytest pytest-cov pytest-asyncio
   ```

3. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

4. **Run from source**:
   ```bash
   uv run python -m src.main upload <url> <bucket> <path>
   ```

### Testing

The project uses pytest for testing with support for async code:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=theloop

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_uploader.py
```

Example test structure:
```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_async_upload():
    # Test async upload functionality
    pass
```

### Adding a New Cloud Provider

1. **Create uploader class** in `services/`:
   ```python
   from theloop.interfaces import Uploader

   class NewProviderUploader(Uploader):
       async def upload_stream_async(self, url: str, bucket: str, path: str) -> None:
           # Implement upload logic
           pass
   ```

2. **Update CLI** in `cli.py`:
   ```python
   def _get_uploader(provider: str, settings: Settings, ...) -> Uploader:
       if provider == "new-provider":
           return NewProviderUploader(...)
       # ... existing providers
   ```

### Code Style and Standards

- Follow PEP 8 for Python code style
- Use type hints throughout the codebase
- Implement proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- Use async/await for I/O operations
- Follow the existing patterns for configuration and logging
