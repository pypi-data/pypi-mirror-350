class DampingTask(PostureTask):
    r"""L2-regularization on joint velocities (a.k.a. *velocity damping*).

    This low-priority task adds a Tikhonov/Levenberg-Marquardt term to the
    quadratic program, making the Hessian strictly positive-definite and
    selecting the **minimum-norm joint velocity** in any redundant or
    near-singular situation. Formally it contributes:

    .. math::
        \frac{1}{2}\,\Delta \mathbf{q}^\top \Lambda\,\Delta \mathbf{q},

    where :math:`\Delta \mathbf{q}\in\mathbb{R}^{n_v}` is the vector of joint
    displacements and :math:`\Lambda = \mathrm{diag}(\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_{n_v})`
    is a diagonal matrix of per-DoF weights provided by ``cost``. A larger
    :math:`\lambda_i` reduces motion in DoF :math:`i`; with no other active
    tasks the robot remains at rest.

    This task does not favor a particular postureâ€”only small instantaneous
    motion. If you need a posture bias, use an explicit :class:`~.PostureTask`.

    .. note::

        Floating-base coordinates are not affected by this task.

    Example:

    .. code-block:: python

        # Uniform damping across all degrees of freedom.
        damping_task = DampingTask(model, cost=1.0)

        # Custom damping.
        cost = np.zeros(model.nv)
        cost[:3] = 1.0  # High damping for the first 3 joints.
        cost[3:] = 0.1  # Lower damping for the remaining joints.
        damping_task = DampingTask(model, cost)

        The damping task does not chase a reference; its desired joint velocity
        is identically **zero**, so the error vector is always

        .. math:: e = \mathbf 0 \in \mathbb R^{n_v}.

        Args:
            configuration: Robot configuration :math:`q`.
