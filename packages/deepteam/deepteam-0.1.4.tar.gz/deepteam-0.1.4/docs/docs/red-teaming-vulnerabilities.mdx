## Quick Summary

Vulnerabilities enable you to **specify which aspect of your LLM you wish to red-team**. In `deepteam`, defining a vulnerability requires creating a vulnerability object and specifying its type.

```python
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import PIILeakage, Bias

pii_leakage = PIILeakage(types=["direct disclosure"])
bias = Bias(type=["race"])
```

:::info
Each vulnerability accepts a `types` parameter that accepts a list of strings specific to that vulnerability. For example, `Bias` accepts "race", "gender", "political", and "religion" as `types`.
:::

To use your defined vulnerabilities, supply it to the `red_team()` method:

```python
from deepteam import red_team
...

red_team(vulnerabilities[pii_leakage, bias], model_callback=..., attacks=[...])
```

`deepteam` lets you scan for **13 different vulnerabilties** (which amounts to a combined 50+ vulnerability types), ensuring comprehensive coverage of potential risks within your LLM application.

These risks and vulnerabilities include:

- **Data Privacy**
  - [PII Leakage](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-pii-leakage)
  - [Prompt Leakage](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-prompt-leakage)
- **Responsible AI**
  - [Bias](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-bias)
  - [Toxicity](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-toxicity)
- **Unauthorized Access**
  - [Unauthorized Access](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-unauthorized-access)
- **Brand Image**
  - [Misinformation](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-misinformation)
  - [Intellectual Property](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-intellectual-property)
  - [ExcessiveAgency](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-excessive-agency)
  - [Robustnesss](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-robustness)
  - [Competition](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-competition)
- **Illegal Risks**
  - [Illegal Activities](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-illegal-activities)
  - [Graphic Content](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-graphic-content)
  - [Personal Safety](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-personal-safety)

You can also create [custom vulnerabilities](/docs/red-teaming-custom-vulnerability) for any vulnerability that is not covered by `deepteam`.

## Five Main LLM Risks

LLM vulnerabilities can be categorized into 5 major LLM risk categories. Think of these categories simply as collections of vulnerabilities.

| LLM Risk Category   | Vulnerabilities                                                                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data Privacy        | `PIILeakage`, `PromptLeakage`                                                            | Data Privacy vulnerabilities can expose confidential information or personal data, leading to potential privacy violations.                                                                                                                                                   |
| Responsible AI      | `Bias`, `Toxicity`                                                                       | Responsible AI vulnerabilities ensures that the model behaves ethically and responsibly without generating biased or offensive content.                                                                                                                                       |
| Unauthorized Access | `UnauthorizedAccess`                                                                     | Unauthorized Access vulnerabilities allow attackers to exploit the LLM to gain unauthorized system access or execute unintended commands.                                                                                                                                     |
| Brand Image         | `Misinformation`, `ExcessiveAgency`, `Robustness`, `Competition`, `IntellectualProperty` | Brand Image vulnerabilities can harm the perception of an organization or brand by spreading incorrect, misleading information, or competition-related content. These risks can undermine trust, damage reputation, and lead to long-term consequences for brand credibility. |
| Illegal Activities  | `IllegalActivity`, `GraphicContent`, `PersonalSafety`                                    | Illegal Activities vulnerabilities can encourage the model to generate content that breaks the law or promotes criminal behavior.                                                                                                                                             |
