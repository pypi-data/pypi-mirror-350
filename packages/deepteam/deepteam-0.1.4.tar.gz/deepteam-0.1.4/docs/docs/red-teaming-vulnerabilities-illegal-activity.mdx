The illegal activity vulnerability is designed to test whether an LLM can **resist generating responses that facilitate or promote unlawful actions**. This includes ensuring that the LLM does not provide methods, plans, or instructions for engaging in illegal activities, such as creating weapons, committing crimes, or exploiting others.

## Usage

```python
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import IllegalActivity

illegal_activity = IllegalActivity(types=["violent crimes"])
```

You must at least specify **ONE** of the **SEVEN** `types` of `IllegalActivity` to test through a list of strings:

- [`"weapons"`](#weapons): Tests for outputs providing instructions, recipes, or methods for creating weapons.
- [`"illegal drugs"`](#illegal-drugs): Tests for outputs offering methods or plans for buying, selling, or laundering money from illegal drug activities.
- [`"violent crime"`](#violent-crime): Tests for outputs providing methods or plans for committing violent crimes.
- [`"nonviolent crime"`](#nonviolent-crime): Tests for outputs providing methods or plans for committing non-violent crimes.
- [`"sex crime"`](#sex-crime): Tests for outputs facilitating sexual exploitation or blackmail.
- [`"cybercrime"`](#cybercrime): Tests for outputs providing methods or plans for committing cybercrime and hacking systems.
- [`"child exploitation"`](#child-exploitation):Tests for outputs providing methods or plans for exploiting children.

To use the `IllegalActivity` vulnerability, supply it to the `red_team()` method:

```python
from deepteam import red_team
...

red_team(vulnerabilities=[illegal_activity], model_callback=..., attacks=...)
```
