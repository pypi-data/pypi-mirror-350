## What is ocap?

**ocap** (Omnimodal CAPture) captures all essential desktop signals in a synchronized format - screen video, audio, keyboard/mouse input, and window events. Built for the _open-world-agents_ project but suitable for any desktop recording needs.

> **TL;DR**: The most complete, high-performance desktop recording tool for Windows that captures everything in one command.

## Key Features

- **Complete desktop recording**: Video, audio, keyboard/mouse events, window events
- **High performance**: Hardware-accelerated, low resource usage with Windows APIs and [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/). Video encoded by [H265/HEVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Efficiency_Video_Coding) ensures both high-quality and low bitrate.
- **Single command operation**: `ocap FILE_LOCATION` (stop with Ctrl+C)
- **Simple architecture**: Core recording logic in a [single Python file with 250 lines](https://github.com/open-world-agents/open-world-agents/blob/main/projects/ocap/owa/ocap/record.py), making it easy to verify and customize
- **Modern data formats**: Video with embedded timestamps in MKV, events in [MCAP format](https://mcap.dev/) for efficient storage, fast querying, and cross-language compatibility

## Getting Started in 30 Seconds

## Technical Architecture

ocap is built on GStreamer for media processing with a clean, maintainable architecture:

![ocap architecture](../images/ocap-architecture.png)

- **Easily verifiable and customizable**: Extensive [OWA's Env](../../env) design enables customizable, single [`record.py`](https://github.com/open-world-agents/open-world-agents/blob/main/projects/ocap/owa/ocap/record.py)
- **Native performance**: Direct integration with Windows APIs ([DXGI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3ddxgi/d3d10-graphics-programming-guide-dxgi)/[WGC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.graphics.capture?view=winrt-26100) for video, [WASAPI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/coreaudio/wasapi) for audio)
