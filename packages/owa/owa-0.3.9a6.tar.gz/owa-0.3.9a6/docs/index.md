# Welcome to Open World Agents

### Everything you need to build state-of-the-art foundation multimodal desktop agent, end-to-end.

Streamline your agent's lifecycle with Open World Agents. From data capture to model training and real-time evaluation, everything is designed for flexibility and performance.

Here's what we've got in store for you!

---

- **OWA's Env**: The asynchronous, event-driven environmental interface for real-time agent
    - **Asynchronous, real-time event processing**: Compared to existing LLM-agent frameworks and [gymnasium.Env](https://gymnasium.farama.org/api/env/), OWA's Env features an asynchronous processing design leveraging `Callables`, `Listeners`, and `Runnables`. [Learn more...](env/index.md)
    - **Dynamic EnvPlugin Activation**: Seamlessly register and activate EnvPlugins at runtime to customize and extend functionality, powered by registry pattern. [Learn more...](env/guide.md)
    - **Extensible, Open-Source Design**: Built for the community, by the community. Easily add custom plugins and extend the Env's functionality to suit your needs. [Learn more...](env/custom_plugins.md)

- **Predefined EnvPlugins**: We provide you some EnvPlugins which is suitable for constructing multimodal desktop agent.
    - [`owa-env-desktop`](env/plugins/desktop_env.md): Provides basic `Callables/Listeners` for mouse/keyboard/window events. 
    - [`owa-env-gst`](env/plugins/gstreamer_env.md): Powered by Windows APIs (`DXGI/WGC`) and the robust [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) framework, provides high-performance and efficient screen capture/recording features. `owa-env-gst`'s screen capture is **6x faster** compared to alternatives. [Learn more...](data/recorder/why.md)

- **OWA's Data**: From high-performance, robust and open-source friendly data format to powerful, efficient and huggingface integration.
    - **`OWAMcap` file format**: high-performance, self-contained, flexible container file format for multimodal desktop log data, powered by the open-source container file format [mcap](https://mcap.dev/). [Learn more...](data/data_format.md)
    - **`ocap your-filename.mcap`**: powerful, efficient and easy-to-use desktop recorder. Contains keyboard/mouse and high-frequency screen data.
        - Powered by [`owa-env-gst`](env/plugins/gstreamer_env.md), ensuring superior performance compared to alternatives. [Learn more...](data/recorder/why.md)
    - **ðŸ¤— [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) Integration**: Upload your own dataset created by simple `ocap` to huggingface and share with everyone! The era of open-source desktop data is **near and effortless**. Preview the dataset at [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/open-world-agents/visualize_dataset).

- **Comprehensive Examples**: We provides various examples that demonstrates how to build foundation multimodal desktop agent. Since it's just a example, you may customize anything you want. **Examples are in progress; stay tuned!**


<!-- - **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows and macOS. -->


## Quick Start

- Simple example of using `Callables` and `Listeners`. [Learn more...](env/index.md)
    ```python
    import time

    from owa.core.registry import CALLABLES, LISTENERS, activate_module

    # Activate the standard environment module
    activate_module("owa.env.std")

    def callback():
        # Get current time in nanoseconds
        time_ns = CALLABLES["clock.time_ns"]()
        print(f"Current time in nanoseconds: {time_ns}")

    # Create a listener for clock/tick event, Set listener to trigger every 1 second
    tick = LISTENERS["clock/tick"]().configure(callback=callback, interval=1)

    # Start the listener
    tick.start()

    # Allow the listener to run for 2 seconds
    time.sleep(2)

    # Stop the listener and wait for it to finish
    tick.stop(), tick.join()

    ```

- Record your own desktop usage data by just running `ocap your-filename.mcap`. [Learn more...](data/recorder/install_and_usage.md)
