    Process pending enrollments after a user instance has been created.

    Bulk enrollment API allows enrolling users with just the email. So learners who
    do not have an account yet would also be enrolled. This information is stored
    in the LearningPathEnrollmentAllowed model. This signal handler processes such
    instances and created the corresponding LearningPathEnrollment objects.
