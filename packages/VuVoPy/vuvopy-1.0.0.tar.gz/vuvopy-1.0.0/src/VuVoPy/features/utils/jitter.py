    """
    Calculate the Pitch Perturbation Quotient (PPQ) jitter for a given audio file.

    This function computes jitter based on the fundamental frequency (F0)
    extracted from a voice signal. Jitter reflects cycle-to-cycle variability
    in F0 and is useful in analyzing vocal stability.

    Args:
        folder_path (str): Path to the WAV audio file to analyze.
        n_points (int, optional): Number of points to average when calculating PPQ. Default is 3.
        plim (tuple, optional): Pitch range in Hz for F0 extraction. Default is (30, 500).
        hop_size (int, optional): Hop size for F0 tracking. Default is 512.
        dlog2p (float, optional): Log2 pitch step size. Default is 1/96.
        dERBs (float, optional): Frequency resolution in ERBs. Default is 0.1.
        sTHR (float, optional): Voicing threshold. Default is -np.inf.

    Returns:
        float: The average PPQ jitter value. Returns 0 if there are not enough F0 values.
