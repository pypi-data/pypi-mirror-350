    """
    Compute the percentage of silence in an audio file using voice activity detection.

    This function loads and preprocesses an audio file, segments it using a specified windowing 
    approach, and applies a voiced/unvoiced/silence detection algorithm to estimate 
    the percentage of silence.

    Args:
        folder_path (str): Path to the audio file (e.g., WAV format).
        winlen (int, optional): Window length for segmentation. Defaults to 512.
        winover (int, optional): Overlap between consecutive windows. Defaults to 496.
        wintype (str, optional): Window type ('hann', 'hamm', 'blackman', 'square'). Defaults to 'hamm'.
        min_silence_duration_ms (int, optional): Minimum duration of silence to count, in milliseconds. Defaults to 100.

    Returns:
        float: Percentage of silence in the audio signal.

    Notes:
        - Ensure the input file is in a compatible format (e.g., mono WAV).
        - The silence detection accuracy depends on the quality of preprocessing and the VAD algorithm.
