    """
    Computes the relative standard deviation of the root mean square (RMS) energy 
    contour of a voice sample after silence removal.

    Parameters:
    -----------
        folder_path : str
            Path to the folder containing the voice sample in WAV format.
        winlen : int, optional
            Length of the analysis window in samples. Default is 512.
        winover : int, optional
            Overlap between consecutive windows in samples. Default is 496.
        wintype : str, optional
            Type of window function to apply (e.g., 'hamm' for Hamming window). Default is 'hamm'.

    Returns:
    --------
    float
        The relative standard deviation (standard deviation divided by the mean) 
        of the RMS energy contour. Returns 0 if the mean RMS energy is zero.
