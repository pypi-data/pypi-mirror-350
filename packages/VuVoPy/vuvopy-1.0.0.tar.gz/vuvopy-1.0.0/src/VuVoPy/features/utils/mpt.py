    """
    Computes the Maximal Phonation Time (MPT) from a given audio file.
    Parameters:
        folder_path (str): The file path to the audio sample in WAV format.
        winlen (int, optional): The length of the analysis window. Default is 512.
        winover (int, optional): The overlap between consecutive windows. Default is 496.
        wintype (str, optional): The type of windowing function to apply (e.g., 'hamm' for Hamming). Default is 'hamm'.
    Returns:
        float: The Maximal Phonation Time (MPT) in seconds, calculated as the total duration of voiced segments.
