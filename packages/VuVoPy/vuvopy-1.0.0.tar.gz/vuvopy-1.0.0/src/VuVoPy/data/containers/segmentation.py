    class Segmented:
        """
        A class for segmenting and preprocessing audio signals.
        The `Segmented` class extends the `Preprocessed` class and provides functionality
        for segmenting audio signals into overlapping frames, applying window functions,
        and storing the segmented data in multiple forms (original, pre-emphasized, and normalized).
        Attributes:
            x (numpy.ndarray): The original waveform.
            fs (int): The sampling rate of the audio signal.
            xnorm (numpy.ndarray): The normalized waveform.
            preem (numpy.ndarray): The pre-emphasized waveform.
            xsegment (numpy.ndarray): A 3D array containing segmented data for the original,
                pre-emphasized, and normalized waveforms.
            winlen (int): The length of the window used for segmentation.
            wintype (str): The type of window function applied (e.g., "hann", "hamming").
            winover (int): The overlap between consecutive windows.
            alpha (float): The pre-emphasis coefficient (default is 0.94).
        Methods:
            from_voice_sample(voice_sample, winlen, wintype, winover, alpha=0.94):
                Class method to create a `Segmented` instance from a voice sample object.
            get_segment():
                Returns the segmented original waveform as a NumPy array.
            get_preem_segment():
                Returns the segmented pre-emphasized waveform as a NumPy array.
            get_norm_segment():
                Returns the segmented normalized waveform as a NumPy array.
            get_sampling_rate():
                Returns the sampling rate of the audio signal.
            get_window_type():
                Returns the type of window function applied.
            get_window_length():
                Returns the length of the window used for segmentation.
            get_window_overlap():
                Returns the overlap between consecutive windows.

        Creates a segmentation object from a voice sample.
        This method processes a voice sample by segmenting it into overlapping frames,
        applying pre-emphasis, normalization, and a specified windowing function.
        Args:
            voice_sample (VoiceSample): The input voice sample object containing waveform,
                                        sampling rate, pre-emphasis, and normalization methods.
            winlen (int): The length of the window (in samples) to be applied to each frame.
            wintype (str): The type of window to apply. Supported types are:
                           "hann", "blackman", "hamm", "square". Defaults to "hamming" if unspecified.
            winover (int): The overlap (in samples) between consecutive frames.
            alpha (float, optional): The pre-emphasis coefficient. Defaults to 0.94.
        Returns:
            Segmentation: An instance of the Segmentation class containing the segmented
                          waveform, sampling rate, normalized waveform, pre-emphasized waveform,
                          and other parameters.
        Raises:
            ValueError: If an unsupported window type is specified.
        Notes:
            - The input waveform is padded with zeros if its length is not a multiple of the window length.
            - The segmentation process generates three versions of the signal: original, pre-emphasized,
              and normalized, each of which is windowed and stored in the output.
