    """
    Calculate the percentage of silence in an audio signal using a windowing approach.

    This function segments the signal using a specified window type and size, detects
    silent segments, and returns the ratio of silence duration to the total duration
    as a percentage.

    Args:
        folder_path (str): Path to the WAV audio file.
        winlen (int, optional): Window length for segmentation. Default is 512.
        winover (int, optional): Overlap between consecutive windows. Default is 496.
        wintype (str, optional): Type of window function to use. Options are:
            'hann', 'hamm', 'blackman', 'square'. Default is 'hamm'.

    Returns:
        float: Percentage of silence in the signal.
