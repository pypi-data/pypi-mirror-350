    Compute the relative standard deviation of the first formant frequency (F1).

    This function segments a WAV audio sample, extracts the first formant (F1),

    Args:
        folder_path (str): Path to the voice sample (WAV).
        winlen (int, optional): Length of the analysis window in samples. Default is 512.
        winover (int, optional): Overlap between consecutive windows in samples. Default is 256.
        wintype (str, optional): Type of window function to use. Default is 'hann'.

    Returns:
        float: Relative standard deviation of the F1 frequency.

    """
    Compute the relative standard deviation of the second formant frequency (F2).

    This function processes a WAV voice sample, segments it using a windowing
    approach, extracts F2 formants, and calculates the relative standard deviation
    (std/mean) of the second formant frequency.

    Args:
        folder_path (str): Path to the WAV file.
        winlen (int, optional): Window length in samples. Default is 512.
        winover (int, optional): Overlap between windows in samples. Default is 256.
        wintype (str, optional): Type of window function. Default is 'hann'.

    Returns:
        float: Relative standard deviation of F2 (std/mean).

    Notes:
        - Requires modules `vs`, `pp`, `sg`, `ff` for preprocessing and formant extraction.
        - Input file must contain a valid speech sample for accurate results.
