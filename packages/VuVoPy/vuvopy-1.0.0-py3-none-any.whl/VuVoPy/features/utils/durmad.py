    """
    Compute the absolute median deviation of silence durations from a voice sample.

    This function processes a voice sample from a given folder path, segments it using
    the specified window parameters, and calculates the silence durations. It then
    returns the absolute median deviation of these silence durations.

    Args:
        folder_path (str): Path to the folder containing the WAV voice sample.
        winlen (int, optional): Length of the analysis window. Default is 512.
        winover (int, optional): Overlap between windows. Default is 496.
        wintype (str, optional): Type of windowing function (e.g., 'hamm' for Hamming). Default is 'hamm'.

    Returns:
        float: Absolute median deviation of silence durations in seconds.
