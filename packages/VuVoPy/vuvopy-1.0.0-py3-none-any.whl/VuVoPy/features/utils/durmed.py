    """
    Calculate the median silence duration from a voice sample.
    This function processes a voice sample from a given file path, segments it
    using specified window parameters, and calculates the median duration of
    silence segments.
    Args:
        folder_path (str): The file path to the voice sample in WAV format.
        winlen (int, optional): The length of the analysis window. Default is 512.
        winover (int, optional): The overlap between consecutive windows. Default is 496.
        wintype (str, optional): The type of window to apply (e.g., 'hamm' for Hamming). Default is 'hamm'.
    Returns:
        float: The median duration of silence segments in the voice sample.
