# there are three stages:
# 1. (making) decisions
# 2. (moving) distributions
# 3. (solving for) aggregte equations
#
# the following definitions are available during all three stages:
definitions: |
    from jax.numpy import log, maximum
    # jax_print can be used for debugging
    from econpizza.tools import percentile, jax_print

# these lists define the relevant models objects
variables: [ div, mc, y, y_prod, w, pi, R, Rn, Rr, Rstar, tax, z, beta, C, n, B, Top10C, Top10A ]
parameters: [ sigma_c, sigma_l, theta, psi, phi_pi, phi_y, rho, rho_beta, rho_r, rho_z ]
shocks: [ e_beta, e_rstar, e_z ]

# this defines all distribution objects (so far, only one distribution is supported)
distributions:
  # the name of the first distribution
  dist:
    # ordering matters. The ordering here is corresponds to the shape of the axis of the distribution
    # the naming of the dimensions (skills, a) is arbitrary
    skills:
      # first dimension
      type: exogenous_rouwenhorst
      rho: 0.966
      sigma: 0.6
      n: 4
    a:
      # second dimension. Endogenous distribution objects require inputs from the decisions stage. An object named 'a' assumes that the decisions stage returns a variable named 'a'

# stage one: iterating the decisions function backwards
decisions:
  # define the multidimensional input "WaPrime", in addition to all aggregated variables (defined in 'variables')
  inputs: [WaPrime]
  calls: |
    # calls executed during the decisions stage
    # these are executed subsequently (top-down)
    # iteration starts with the last in time T and then iterating backwards
    # each call takes the previous input (Wa as WaPrime) as given
    # these functions are defined in functions_file
    tfs = transfers(skills_stationary, div, tax, skills_grid)
    WaPrimeExp = skills_transition @ WaPrime
    Wa, a, c = egm_step(WaPrimeExp, a_grid, skills_grid, w, n, tfs, Rr, beta, sigma_c, sigma_l)
  # the 'outputs' values are stored for the following stages
  # NOTE: each output must have the same shape as the distribution (here: 4,40)
  outputs: [a,c]

# stage two: iterating the distribution forwards
# This is done automatically using the information provided in 'distributions'
# inputs are all grid_variables and, for endogenous distribution variables, the outputs from the decisions stage.
# NOTE: for endogenous distributions, the output variables must be named appropiately, i.e. like the members of 'distributions' (e.g. here 'a')
# outputs are the distribution(s) named as define in 'distributions' (e.g. here 'dist')

# intermediate stage (optional): aux_equations
# these can contain misc definitions that are available during the final stage.
# outputs from decisions, the grid variables, the distributions and
# aggregate variables from 'variables' (including those with "Prime", "Lag",...) are included by default
# from here on the objects are _sequences_ with shapes (..., horizon), i.e. the last dimension is always the time dimension
aux_equations: |
    # NOTE: summing over the first two dimensions e and a, but not the time dimension (dimension 2)
    # `dist` here corresponds to the dist *at the beginning of the period*
