# Hampel Filter

This project provides an efficient implementation of the Hampel filter for outlier detection, leveraging Numbaâ€™s JIT compilation to improve performance. It supports both serial and parallel computation modes for median and median absolute deviation (MAD) calculations, making it ideal for processing large datasets.

## Installation

Make sure to have `Numba`, `NumPy`, and `Pandas` installed:

```bash
pip install numba numpy pandas
```

and then you can install the package

```bash
pip install hampel_filter
```

## Usage

This package contains functions for outlier detection in time-series or sequence data using the Hampel filter. The main function `hampel()` identifies outliers by calculating the median and median absolute deviation (MAD) within a specified window size and compares it to a threshold to detect outliers.

### Function: `hampel`

```python
def hampel(arr, window_size=5, n=3, parallel=False, return_indices=True)
```

#### Parameters:
- `arr` (`np.ndarray`, `pd.Series`, or `pd.DataFrame`): The input data array for outlier detection.
- `window_size` (`int`, default=5): The half-size of the moving window for median calculation.
- `n` (`int`, default=3): The threshold factor; outliers are values beyond `n` times the MAD.
- `parallel` (`bool`, default=False): Whether to use parallel computation. When `True`, it leverages multi-core processing.
- `return_indices` (`bool`, default=True): If `True`, returns the indices of outliers; otherwise, returns a boolean array indicating outliers.

#### Returns:
- If `return_indices` is `True`, returns a tuple of arrays with outlier indices.
- If `return_indices` is `False`, returns a boolean array where `True` indicates outliers.

### Example

```python
import numpy as np
from hampel_filter import hampel  # Assuming the script is named hampel_filter.py

# Sample data with outliers
data = np.array([1, 1, 2, 2, 100, 2, 2, 1, 1])

# Detect outliers
outlier_indices = hampel(data, window_size=2, n=3, parallel=True)

print("Outlier indices:", outlier_indices)
```

### Detailed Functions

The implementation includes the following helper functions:

- `calc_medians(window_size, arr, medians)`: Calculates the moving median over a specified window.
- `calc_medians_std(window_size, arr, medians, medians_diff)`: Computes the median absolute deviation (MAD) for outlier detection.
- `calc_medians_parallel` and `calc_medians_std_parallel`: Parallel versions of the above functions using `prange` for improved performance.

## Performance Notes

By setting `parallel=True`, the Hampel filter calculation leverages Numba's parallel processing capabilities, significantly speeding up the computations on large arrays. However, performance gains depend on your system's CPU cores and load.
