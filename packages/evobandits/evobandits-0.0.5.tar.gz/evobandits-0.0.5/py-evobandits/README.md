EvoBandits (Evolutionary Multi-Armed Bandits) is an innovative optimization algorithm designed to tackle stochastic problems with high efficiency. By combining genetic algorithms with multi-armed bandit mechanisms, EvoBandits offers a unique, reinforcement learning-based approach to solving complex, large-scale optimization issues. Whether you're working in operations research, machine learning, or data science, EvoBandits provides a robust, scalable solution for optimizing your stochastic models.

## Usage
To install EvoBandits, add the following to your Cargo.toml file:

```bash
pip install evobandits
```

```python
from evobandits import EvoBandits

def test_function(number: list) -> float:
    # your function here

if __name__ == '__main__':
    bounds = [(-5, 10), (-5, 10)]
    evobandits = EvoBandits(test_function, bounds)
    evaluation_budget = 10000
    result = evobandits.optimize(evaluation_budget)
    print(result)
```
