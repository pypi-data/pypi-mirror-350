## Installation

pybaseballstats can be installed using pip or any other package manager (I use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)).

Examples:

```bash
pip install pybaseballstats
```

or:

```bash
uv add pybaseballstats

Usage documentation can be found in this [folder](usage_docs/). This documentation is a work in progress and will be updated as I add more functionality to the package.

I work on this in my free time, but I will do my best to fix any issues that are opened. To submit a pull request, please fork the repository and make your changes on a new branch. Make your changes and please create new tests if you are adding new functionality (updates to my own tests are more than welcome as well). Make sure all tests pass and once you are finished, submit a pull request and I will review your changes.

## Credit and Acknowledgement

This project was heavily inspired by the pybaseball package by James LeDoux. The goal of this project is to provide a similar set of functionality with continual updates and improvements, as the original pybaseball package has lagged behind with updates and key functionality has been broken (hence my decision to create this new package).

All of the data scraped by this package is publicly available and free to use. All credit for the data goes to the organizations from which it was scraped.
