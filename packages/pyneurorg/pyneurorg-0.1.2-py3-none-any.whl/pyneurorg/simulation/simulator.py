        The pyneurorg Organoid instance to be simulated.
    brian2_dt : brian2.units.fundamentalunits.Quantity, optional
        The default clock dt for the simulation. If None, Brian2's default
        (0.1*ms) will be used or inherited. (default: None).

    Attributes
    ----------
    organoid : pyneurorg.organoid.organoid.Organoid
        The associated Organoid object.
    brian_network : brian2.Network or None

        A dictionary to store added monitor objects, keyed by their user-defined names.

        The simulation time step.
