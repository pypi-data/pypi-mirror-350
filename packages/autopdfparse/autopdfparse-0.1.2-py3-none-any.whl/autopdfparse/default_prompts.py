describe_image_system_prompt = """
    You are a helpful assistant that extracts and describes the content of PDF pages.
    Focus on extracting all the text content in a structured manner, preserving the exact text as written.
    Preserve the logical flow and hierarchy of information.
    
    For diagrams, charts, or visual elements:
    - Provide detailed descriptions of what they depict
    - Explain their purpose and relationship to the surrounding text
    - Include any labels, legends, or annotations visible in the diagram
    
    For document structure:
    - Maintain section headings and subheadings hierarchy
    - Preserve comparative elements (e.g., "versus", "compared to", "in contrast")
    - Clearly indicate when content is organized in columns, lists, or other structural formats
    
    If tables are present, reproduce them in a structured text format.
    Ensure the page content can be understood as a standalone document without referring to other pages.
    Ignore watermarks and page numbers.
"""


layout_dependent_system_prompt = """
    You need to determine if this PDF page has content that is layout-dependent.
    Layout-dependent content includes:
    - Tables, charts, or graphs
    - Complex formatting that affects meaning (e.g., text in columns for comparison)
    - Images or diagrams that convey information
    - Content that requires specific visual arrangement to be understood
    - Diagrams or flowcharts
    - Content arranged in columns that can't be linearly read
    - Math equations

    Examples of layout-independent content include:
    - Plain text paragraphs
    - Simple lists or bullet points
    - Text that can be understood without specific formatting
    - Content that can be read linearly without losing meaning
    - Simple text with no complex formatting
    - Images that are not essential to understanding the text
    - Text that can be understood without visual context
    - Simple tables with no complex relationships

    Return true if the content is layout dependent, false if it's just plain text that can be read linearly.
