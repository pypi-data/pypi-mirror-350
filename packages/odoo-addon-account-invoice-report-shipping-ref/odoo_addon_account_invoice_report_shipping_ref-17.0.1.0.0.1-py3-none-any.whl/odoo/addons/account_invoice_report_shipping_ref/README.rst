This module allows each company to define a custom label for displaying
the delivery address reference on customer invoice PDFs. The reference
(ref) from the delivery address contact is shown above the invoice
lines, using the format: "Label: Reference". If no reference is set,
nothing is displayed. If no label is defined, the default "Shipping
Address Ref." label is used.

Configuration
=============

invoice PDF for the delivery address reference, go to: Invoicing >
Configuration > Settings, under the Customer Invoices section.

shipping contact reference in the invoice report.
