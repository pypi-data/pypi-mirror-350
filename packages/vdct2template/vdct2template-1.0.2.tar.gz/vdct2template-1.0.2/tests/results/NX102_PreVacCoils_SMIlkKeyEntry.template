# NX102_PreVacCoils_SMIlkKeyEntry.vdb is expanded to
#  NX102_PreVacCoils_SMSIlkKeyEntry.template by VDCT utility called flatdb.
#
# Developed for B07 HiTES1 End Station.  Currently does not use VDB
# expansion of lower level template vdb files.
#
# Allows the builder to construct a screen of interlock descriptions.
# Descriptions are REALLY important for HiTES1 as it has many interlocks.  The
# standard interlocks embedded screen does not have any support for describing
# the interlock as a whole, only the individual bits.
#
# % macro, __doc__, Template for Interlock Key Entry for sample manipulator collaboration.
#
# % macro, device,        Mandatory.  Device name.
# % macro, keyentryname,  Mandatory.  Name of interlock being described in the key entry.  Used in constructing record names, so no spaces or iffy punctuation characters.
# % macro, keyentryline1, Mandatory.  First line of interlock description.
# 
# % macro, ilkkeyprefix,  Optional.   Defaults to :ILKKEY.      Prefix to put on the key entry records.
# % macro, keyentryline2, Optional.   Defaults to single space. Second line of interlock description.
#
# % macro, name,          Optional.   Defaults to empty.        Object name and associated gui name
#
# This associates an EDM screen with the template
# % gui, $(name=), edmembed, NX102_PreVacSMIlkKeyEntry-embed.edl, device=$(device), ilkkeyprefix=$(ilkkeyprefix=:ILKKEY), keyentryname=$(keyentryname), keyentryline1=$(keyentryline1), keyentryline2=$(keyentryline2= )
#
# Although this record is not used on the screen decided to make it give the correct information
# i.e. initially it is a dummy.  Might have to change screen to use it as a PV and add some more.
#
