# NX102_PreVacCoils_SMPort.vdb is expanded to NX102_PreVacCoils_SMPort.template by flatdb.
#
# Developed for B07 HiTES1 End Station.  This is a higher level template which declares VDB expansion
# of lower level template NX102_PreVacCoils_SMPortPostionStatus.vdb
#
# Coil is the term PreVac use for a piece of data about a component
# or aspect of the the Sample Manipulator system.  We dont know what it
# actually means.
#
# Some of the PreVac Coils are R, others RW; there are concerns about
# about reading and writing to the same piece of data with this driver.
# Also they are in groups of 10, with info re certain aspects of the system.
# The NX102 PLC code collates the coils into readonly words more convenient
# to read back.  This template deals with one of the groups of 10 of the
# original coils.  The actual Coils can be read back but this should be made
# unnecessary by the collated words and so is not implemented.
#
#% macro, __doc__, Template database for status info regarding a Port on PreVac Sample Manipulator.
#
#% macro, device,        Mandatory. Device name.
#% macro, posportID,     Mandatory. ID of the vacuum port position for the sample manipulator.  Must be integer 1 to 8 or 0 for special case of Arm in RDC/UFO and overall status.
#% macro, port,          Mandatory. Comms port (DLS NX102) PLC controller is on.
#% macro, tag,           Mandatory. NX PLC tag string e.g. V (from V.Control[1])
#% macro, tagidx,        Mandatory. NX PLC tag index number e.g. 1 (from V.Control[1])
#% macro, tagname,       Mandatory. NX PLC tag name.
#% macro, tagprefix,     Mandatory. NX PLC prefix to tag name.
#
#% macro, posportprefix, Optional.  Defaults to ":POSPORT".            Prefix for the vacuum port position records.
#% macro, smready_bitno, Optional.  Defaults to "1".                   Bit number in port position status for whether sample manipulator inside the chamber is in position ready to participate in the transfer, values 0-15.  The Arm/RDC/UFO port is likely to have non-default value, as it needs to address the "Master Interlock Status" bit, whereas the other ports address the "ReadyForTransfer" bit.  NOTE: The intended use is for signals derived from GPIO on GeoBricks with other sample manipulator motors on them.
#% macro, sampleholder_bitno, Optional.  Defaults to "2".              Bit number in port position status for whether sample holder is present inside the chamber, values 0-15.  The Arm/RDC/UFO port is likely to have non-default value, as it needs to address the "Holder On Arm" bit, whereas the other ports address the "Sample Inside" bit.  NOTE: The sample holder might not have a sample in it!
#% macro, desc_label0,   Optional.  Defaults to "PrepareForTransfer".  Descriptive label for bit0 of the Coil word.
#% macro, desc_label1,   Optional.  Defaults to "ReadyForTransfer".    Descriptive label for bit1 of the Coil word.
#% macro, desc_label2,   Optional.  Defaults to "SampleInside".        Descriptive label for bit2 of the Coil word.
#% macro, desc_label3,   Optional.  Defaults to "Error".               Descriptive label for bit3 of the Coil word.
#% macro, desc_label4,   Optional.  Defaults to "Busy".                Descriptive label for bit4 of the Coil word.

#% macro, desc_label8,   Optional.  Defaults to "ArmOnPort".           Descriptive label for bit8 of the Coil word.
#% macro, desc_label9,   Optional.  Defaults to "ReservedForFuture".   Descriptive label for bit9 of the Coil word.
#% macro, desc_label10,  Optional.  Defaults to "".                    Descriptive label for bit10 of the Coil word.
#% macro, desc_label11,  Optional.  Defaults to "".                    Descriptive label for bit11 of the Coil word.
#% macro, desc_label12,  Optional.  Defaults to "".                    Descriptive label for bit12 of the Coil word.
#% macro, desc_label13,  Optional.  Defaults to "".                    Descriptive label for bit13 of the Coil word.
#% macro, desc_label14,  Optional.  Defaults to "".                    Descriptive label for bit14 of the Coil word.
#% macro, desc_label15,  Optional.  Defaults to "".                    Descriptive label for bit15 of the Coil word.
#% macro, longdesc,      Optional.  Defaults to "Manipulator Position Port $(posportID) status."  Description of position port.
#% macro, shortdesc,     Optional.  Defaults to "Posport$(posportID)"  Short, abbreviated description of position port.
#
#% macro, chamber_name,      Optional.  Defaults to "".               Name of vacuum chamber associated with position port.
#% macro, chamber_shortname, Optional.  Defaults to "".               Short name of vacuum chamber associated with position port.
#
#% macro, valve_device,      Optional.  Defaults to "".               Device name of vacuum valve associated with position port.  So far it is a string for info only, no calcs.

#
# The expand command cannot appear first in the vdb file because the
# comment on an expand command gets zapped during the expansion
# processing by flat db, so it will consume the header with all the
# macro definitions in it, which has to be attached to a statement
# because VDCT itself zaps comments which have blank lines or spaces
# leaving them unattached.  Therefore have chosen to put the expansion
# last.
#
# There are further macros defined in the template which do not have
# an entry in the expand command and they are passed through
# untouched, notably device and posportID.  The posportprefix and
# label macros are mandatory in the lower level template and expanded
# to become optional in the high level template.
