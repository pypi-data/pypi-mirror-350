        ``'macro'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their unweighted
            mean.  This does not take label imbalance into account.
        ``'weighted'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their average, weighted
            by support (the number of true instances for each label).
        ``'samples'``:

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <roc_metrics>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : array-like of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, n_classes)
        True labels or binary label indicators. The binary and multiclass cases
        expect labels with shape (n_samples,) while the multilabel case expects
        binary label indicators with shape (n_samples, n_classes).

    y_score : array-like of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, n_classes)
        Target scores.

        * In the binary case, it corresponds to an array of shape
          `(n_samples,)`. Both probability estimates and non-thresholded
          decision values can be provided. The probability estimates correspond
          to the **probability of the class with the greater label**,
          i.e. `estimator.classes_[1]` and thus
          `estimator.predict_proba(X, y)[:, 1]`. The decision values
          corresponds to the output of `estimator.decision_function(X, y)`.
          See more information in the :ref:`User guide <roc_auc_binary>`;
        * In the multiclass case, it corresponds to an array of shape
          `(n_samples, n_classes)` of probability estimates provided by the
          `predict_proba` method. The probability estimates **must**
          sum to 1 across the possible classes. In addition, the order of the
          class scores must correspond to the order of ``labels``,
          if provided, or else to the numerical or lexicographical order of
          the labels in ``y_true``. See more information in the
          :ref:`User guide <roc_auc_multiclass>`;
        * In the multilabel case, it corresponds to an array of shape
          `(n_samples, n_classes)`. Probability estimates are provided by the
          `predict_proba` method and the non-thresholded decision values by
          the `decision_function` method. The probability estimates correspond
          to the **probability of the class with the greater label for each
          output** of the classifier. See more information in the
          :ref:`User guide <roc_auc_multilabel>`.

    average : {'micro', 'macro', 'samples', 'weighted'} or None, \
            default='macro'
        If ``None``, the scores for each class are returned.
        Otherwise, this determines the type of averaging performed on the data.
        Note: multiclass ROC AUC currently only handles the 'macro' and
        'weighted' averages. For multiclass targets, `average=None` is only
        implemented for `multi_class='ovr'` and `average='micro'` is only
        implemented for `multi_class='ovr'`.

        ``'micro'``:
            Calculate metrics globally by considering each element of the label
            indicator matrix as a label.
        ``'macro'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their unweighted
            mean.  This does not take label imbalance into account.
        ``'weighted'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their average, weighted
            by support (the number of true instances for each label).
        ``'samples'``:
            Calculate metrics for each instance, and find their average.

        Will be ignored when ``y_true`` is binary.

    sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        Sample weights.

    max_fpr : float > 0 and <= 1, default=None
        If not ``None``, the standardized partial AUC [2]_ over the range
        [0, max_fpr] is returned. For the multiclass case, ``max_fpr``,
        should be either equal to ``None`` or ``1.0`` as AUC ROC partial
        computation currently is not supported for multiclass.

    multi_class : {'raise', 'ovr', 'ovo'}, default='raise'
        Only used for multiclass targets. Determines the type of configuration
        to use. The default value raises an error, so either
        ``'ovr'`` or ``'ovo'`` must be passed explicitly.

        ``'ovr'``:
            Stands for One-vs-rest. Computes the AUC of each class
            against the rest [3]_ [4]_. This
            treats the multiclass case in the same way as the multilabel case.
            Sensitive to class imbalance even when ``average == 'macro'``,
            because class imbalance affects the composition of each of the
            'rest' groupings.
        ``'ovo'``:
            Stands for One-vs-one. Computes the average AUC of all
            possible pairwise combinations of classes [5]_.
            Insensitive to class imbalance when
            ``average == 'macro'``.

    labels : array-like of shape (n_classes,), default=None
        Only used for multiclass targets. List of labels that index the
        classes in ``y_score``. If ``None``, the numerical or lexicographical
        order of the labels in ``y_true`` is used.

    Returns
    -------
    auc : float
        Area Under the Curve score.

    See Also
    --------
    average_precision_score : Area under the precision-recall curve.

        (ROC) curve given an estimator and some data.
    RocCurveDisplay.from_predictions : Plot Receiver Operating Characteristic

    Notes
    -----
    The Gini Coefficient is a summary measure of the ranking ability of binary
    classifiers. It is expressed using the area under of the ROC as follows:

    G = 2 * AUC - 1

    Where G is the Gini coefficient and AUC is the ROC-AUC score. This normalisation
    will ensure that random guessing will yield a score of 0 in expectation, and it is
    upper bounded by 1.

    Note: this implementation is restricted to the binary classification task.

    The precision is the ratio ``tp / (tp + fp)`` where ``tp`` is the number of
    true positives and ``fp`` the number of false positives. The precision is
    intuitively the ability of the classifier not to label as positive a sample
    that is negative.

    The recall is the ratio ``tp / (tp + fn)`` where ``tp`` is the number of
    true positives and ``fn`` the number of false negatives. The recall is
    intuitively the ability of the classifier to find all the positive samples.

    The last precision and recall values are 1. and 0. respectively and do not
    have a corresponding threshold. This ensures that the graph starts on the
    y axis.

    The first precision and recall values are precision=class balance and recall=1.0
    which corresponds to a classifier that always predicts the positive class.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        True binary labels. If labels are not either {-1, 1} or {0, 1}, then
        pos_label should be explicitly given.

    y_score : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        Target scores, can either be probability estimates of the positive
        class, confidence values, or non-thresholded measure of decisions
        (as returned by "decision_function" on some classifiers).
        For :term:`decision_function` scores, values greater than or equal to
        zero should indicate the positive class.

    pos_label : int, float, bool or str, default=None
        The label of the positive class.
        When ``pos_label=None``, if `y_true` is in {-1, 1} or {0, 1},
        ``pos_label`` is set to 1, otherwise an error will be raised.

    sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        Sample weights.

    drop_intermediate : bool, default=True
        Whether to drop some suboptimal thresholds which would not appear
        on a plotted ROC curve. This is useful in order to create lighter
        ROC curves.

        .. versionadded:: 0.17
           parameter *drop_intermediate*.

    Returns
    -------
    fpr : ndarray of shape (>2,)
        Increasing false positive rates such that element i is the false
        positive rate of predictions with score >= `thresholds[i]`.

    tpr : ndarray of shape (>2,)
        Increasing true positive rates such that element `i` is the true
        positive rate of predictions with score >= `thresholds[i]`.

    thresholds : ndarray of shape (n_thresholds,)
        Decreasing thresholds on the decision function used to compute
        fpr and tpr. `thresholds[0]` represents no instances being predicted
        and is arbitrarily set to `np.inf`.

    See Also
    --------
    RocCurveDisplay.from_estimator : Plot Receiver Operating Characteristic
        (ROC) curve given an estimator and some data.
    RocCurveDisplay.from_predictions : Plot Receiver Operating Characteristic

    det_curve: Compute error rates for different probability thresholds.
    roc_auc_score : Compute the area under the ROC curve.

    Notes
    -----
    Since the thresholds are sorted from low to high values, they
    are reversed upon returning them to ensure they correspond to both ``fpr``
    and ``tpr``, which are sorted in reversed order during their calculation.

    An arbitrary threshold is added for the case `tpr=0` and `fpr=0` to
    ensure that the curve starts at `(0, 0)`. This threshold corresponds to the
    `np.inf`.

    y_true : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        True labels.

    y_score : array-like of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, n_classes)
        Target scores. These can be either probability estimates or

        The binary case expects scores with shape (n_samples,) while the
        multiclass case expects scores with shape (n_samples, n_classes).
        In the multiclass case, the order of the class scores must

        the numerical or lexicographical order of the labels in ``y_true``.
        If ``y_true`` does not contain all the labels, ``labels`` must be
        provided.

    k : int, default=2
        Number of most likely outcomes considered to find the correct label.

    normalize : bool, default=True
        If `True`, return the fraction of correctly classified samples.
        Otherwise, return the number of correctly classified samples.

    sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        Sample weights. If `None`, all samples are given the same weight.

    labels : array-like of shape (n_classes,), default=None
        Multiclass only. List of labels that index the classes in ``y_score``.
        If ``None``, the numerical or lexicographical order of the labels in
        ``y_true`` is used. If ``y_true`` does not contain all the labels,
        ``labels`` must be provided.

    Returns
    -------
    score : float
        The top-k accuracy score. The best performance is 1 with
        `normalize == True` and the number of samples with
        `normalize == False`.

    See Also
    --------
    accuracy_score : Compute the accuracy score. By default, the function will
        return the fraction of correct predictions divided by the total number
        of predictions.

    Notes
    -----
    In cases where two or more labels are assigned equal predicted scores,
    the labels with the highest indices will be chosen first. This might
    impact the result if the correct label falls after the threshold because
    of that.
