## Description

`gmsaas` is a command line interface to rule all your virtual devices hosted in Genymotion SaaS solution without opening an Internet browser. With it you can list, start and stop devices. Above all, you can securely connect to any devices through Android Debug Bridge.

It is a lightweight binary, easy to install, easy to update.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or above
- pip3
- Android SDK

## Installation

```bash
pip3 install [--user] gmsaas
```

Two steps are required to use `gmsaas` properly:

  ```bash
  gmsaas config set android-sdk-path <sdk_path>
  ```

- Authenticate with:
