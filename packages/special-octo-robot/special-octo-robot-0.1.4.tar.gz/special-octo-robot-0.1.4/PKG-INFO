# Devcord

Devcord is a CLI tool designed to help you quickly manage your tasks as well as
help you monitor your time usage. Along with all the essential to-do list functionalities, Devcord allows you to select a task and start a session on it.

During a session, your time-spent on each of your activity is monitored for you to view later. This is useful for people who want to find out where their time is spent.

None of the data is stored on any server, it is all stored locally on your machine.

# Installation

With pip:

```bash
pip install --upgrade devcord
```

# Post Installation

To avoid typing devcord repetitively, register an alias in your shell configuration file.

For bash:

```bash
alias tasks="devcord tasks"
alias task="devcord task"
```

# Usage

## For adding tasks

Simple add task:

```bash
$ devcord tasks -a "task name"
$ devcord tasks --add "task name"
```

With description:

```bash
$ devcord tasks -a "task name" -d
$ devcord tasks --add "task name" --desc
```

_Opens scrollable text box to enter description_

With due date:

```bash
$ devcord tasks -a "task name" -dd "dd/mm/yyyy"
$ devcord tasks --add "task name" --due "dd/mm/yyyy"
```

Complete by today:

```bash
$ devcord tasks -a "task name" -t
$ devcord tasks --add "task name" --today
```

Complete in current week:

```bash
$ devcord tasks -a "task name" -w
$ devcord tasks --add "task name" --week
```

With priority (1-5):

```bash
$ devcord tasks -a "task name" -p 3
$ devcord tasks --add "task name" --priority 3
```

With labels:

```bash
$ devcord tasks -a "task name" -lb "label"
$ devcord tasks --add "task name" --label "label"
```

Add subtask:

```bash
$ devcord tasks -a "task name" -st
$ devcord tasks --add "task name" --subtask
```

## For listing tasks

By default, in-progress and pending tasks are listed, with in-progress first followed by pending tasks and completed tasks are skipped.

Simple List tasks:

```bash
$ devcord tasks -l
$ devcord tasks --list
```

With subtasks:

```bash
$ devcord tasks -l -st
$ devcord tasks --list --subtasks
```

List tasks by priority:

```bash
$ devcord tasks -l -p 3
$ devcord tasks --list --priority 3
```

List tasks by label:

```bash
$ devcord tasks -l -lb "label"
$ devcord tasks --list --label "label"
```

List today's tasks:

```bash
$ devcord tasks -l -t
$ devcord tasks --list --today
```

List tasks due in current week:

```bash
$ devcord tasks -l -w
$ devcord tasks --list --week
```

List tasks by status:

```bash
$ devcord tasks -l -i
$ devcord tasks --list --completed
$ devcord tasks -l --pending
```

Specify Output Format:

```bash
$ devcord tasks -l -o json
$ devcord tasks --list --output text
```

Specify Output File:

```bash
$ devcord tasks -l --path "path/to/file"
```
## For managing tasks

Pass the keyword to perform required action on the task. The command will then prompt you through a fuzzy finder to enter
the task title. The keyword action would be performed on the selected task.

## Jira Integration

With Jira integration you can view all your issues on devcord itself and sync
them as when required with a single command. On your first use instead of the following commands,
you'd be asked to set up your configuration for Jira.

Sync with Jira

```bash
$ devcord jira --sync
```

Set Organization URL

```bash
$ devcord jira --url
```

Set Organization Email

```bash
$ devcord jira --email
```

Set Jira Access token

```bash
$ devcord jira --token
```

## Miscellaneous

Update Database Schema:

```bash
$ devcord init --migrate
```
This updates the database schema if any changes were made

Use Rich Tree:

```bash
$ devcord init --pretty_tree False
```

Use Pretty Tree:

```bash
$ devcord init --pretty_tree True
```
