# pK Spectroscopy

## Description

This library is intended to perform the pK-spectroscopic evaluation of substances and mixtures of a complex acidic nature using results of the potentiometric titration. This approach could be helpful for the wine production and other natural or synthetic objects.

For convenience, the user-friendly app is attached as the usage example for the generic cases.
