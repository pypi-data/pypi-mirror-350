What is Semantic Branch?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
``semantic_branch`` is a Python library that provides a comprehensive system for working with semantic git branch names. It offers a structured approach to branch naming that helps developers and CI/CD systems understand the purpose and type of work being done on a branch.

The library allows you to:

- Validate branch names against a set of semantic rules
- Detect branch types (feature, fix, release, etc.)
- Ensure consistent branch naming across development workflows
- Provide robust branch name parsing and categorization

Key Features:

- Validate semantic branch names
- Detect branch types using predefined semantic stubs
- Support for various branch naming conventions

For a complete guide with detailed usage examples and advanced techniques, visit the `comprehensive documentation <https://semantic-branch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
