This module introduces the `Entity` class, an extension of the `Data` model designed to represent
entities with enhanced capabilities for introspection and optional persistence. The `Entity` class
includes functionalities for tracking creation time, calculating age, and, if enabled, automatically
saving the entity's state to a JSON file upon destruction.

Features:
- Tracking of creation time with nanosecond precision.
- Optional auto-saving to JSON upon destruction, facilitating simple state persistence.
- Introspection capabilities, including access to the entity's class name and age calculation.

Usage:
The `Entity` class is suited for applications that require detailed lifecycle management of entities,
such as in simulation environments, complex data models, or systems where state persistence and introspection are valuable.
