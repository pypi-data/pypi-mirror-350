```

## Configuration

On first run, you'll be prompted for the location of your `config.fb` file.

You can:
- Press Enter to auto-create a default one at:
  - `~/.fbcli/config.fb` (Linux/macOS)
  - `C:\Users\yourname\.fbcli\config.fb` (Windows)

- Or paste a full path like:
  - Windows: `"C:\Users\you\Documents\config.fb"`
  - macOS/Linux: `/Users/you/config.fb`

The file should look like:

```python
servers = {
    "fb-web-1": {"host": "192.168.1.112", "user": "fbadmin"},
    "fb-rp": {"host": "192.168.1.186", "user": "fbadmin"},
}
```

Your chosen path will be saved automatically for future runs.
