Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to Survey > Surveys.
#. Create or edit a certification survey.
#. Configure whether you want to send certifications manually by checking the 
   "Skip Auto Email" option.
#. Participants who pass the survey will receive their certification automatically if 
   manual submission is not enabled.
#. If the automatic sending is disabled, passed certifications can be submitted manually 
   from the "Send certification email" action.
#. Certifications that have already been sent will be marked as "Certification sent".
#. Passed certifications can be sent as many times as necessary.
