Description-Content-Type: text/markdown

Welcome to statcat.

This is my first project. I plan on making it continuous. Please do not hesitate to make suggestions to my code.
I wrote the first 4 functions on the same day I learned to code in Python. Expect some errors.

More detailed descriptions will be found wherever I put the documentation later.

WHAT I DON'T HAVE THAT statistics DOES:
    mode
    multimode
    quantiles
    kde
    kde_random
    covariance
    correlation
    linear_regression

I will slowly
yet eventually
make this list empty.

Contents are not thorough.
Tests are not comprehensive.
Objects are incomplete.

So be it.

The code will run.

For pull requests:
    Generally follow my pattern/style.
    If i'm not following convention, just tell me in the request.
    Otherwise, if it's valid statistics, you're good.

Honestly, I have no idea what I'm doing so I'm trying to keep stuff familiar as I learn.

For the record: ChatGPT has coded some of this. If stuff doesn't follow how I normally code, it's probably not me.
Also for the record: It is hardly more than 5% of the codebase, if any significant amount at all. If it's obvious, I beg you change it.
