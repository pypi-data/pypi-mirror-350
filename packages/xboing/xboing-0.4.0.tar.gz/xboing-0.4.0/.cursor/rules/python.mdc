- All code must comply with [PEP 8](mdc:https:/peps.python.org/pep-0008) (style guide)
- Use modern, concise docstrings for all public classes, methods, and functions, following PEP 257 conventions.
- Use [PEP 484](mdc:https:/peps.python.org/pep-0484) type hints everywhere: annotate all function/method arguments, return types, and class attributes.
- Use precise types (e.g., `List[pygame.event.Event]`, `Optional[Type]`, `Callable`, etc.), not just `Any`.
- Cross-reference related modules to ensure correct types for arguments and attributes.
- Do not use hasattr except as a last resort, favor isinstance
- Use `# type: ignore` only as a last resort, and always with a comment explaining why.
- Format all code with [black](mdc:https:/black.readthedocs.io/en/stable) before committing or running tests.
- Do not manually adjust formatting that black would change.
- Run the full test suite (`pytest`) before and after every code change. All tests must pass (100% pass rate) before marking a task as complete.
- For each code change:
  1. Update `TODO.md` to add tasks.
  2. Mark tasks as in progress with [p].
  3. Run `hatch run lint-fix` and resolve all issues.
  4. Run `pylint` for src and scripts directories and resolve all issues.
  5. Run `pytest` to ensure all tests pass.
  6. Make new code changes in both src and tests, while maintaining PEP 8, PEP 484, and PEP 257 compliance.
  7. Run `pylint` for src and scripts directories and modify code to resolve issues.
  8. Run `hatch run lint-fix` again to modify code to resolve issues.
  9. Run `pytest` to ensure all tests pass and modify code to resolve issues.
  10. Go back to step 7-9 until no code changes are made.
  11. Update `TODO.md` to remove completed tasks.
- Do not attempt to fix linter errors more than 3 times in a row; ask for help if issues persist.
