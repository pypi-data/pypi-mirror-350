"""Engine package for XBoing, providing core game engine components.

This package provides a clean abstraction over SDL2 (via pygame) for:
- Window management
- Input handling
- Graphics rendering
- Audio playback

The engine components are designed to hide the underlying SDL2 implementation
details from the game logic.
