TintX is an adaptation of the tint [tracking algorithm](https://github.com/openradar/TINT).
Tint and tintX are easy-to-use storm cell tracking packages. While Tint is meant
to be applied to radar data using the
[py-ART toolkit](http://arm-doe.github.io/pyart/) tintX can
be applied with any data - for example output from numerical weather prediction
models. The original tracking algorithm has been developed by a team of
researchers at Monash University [Raut et al. 2020](http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAMC-D-20-0119.1).

## Installation
The `tintX` package can be installed using the `conda-froge` conda channel:

```console
conda install -c conda-forge tintx
```

Alternatively the package can be installed with pip:
```console
python -m pip install tintx
```


## Usage
Documentation can be found on the
[official documentation page](https://tintx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) of this
library.

If you just want to try the usage and play with tracking data you can follow
[this link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/antarcticrainforest/tintX/main?labpath=Readme.ipynb)
to launch and familiarise yourself with the tracking by executing one of the
example notebooks.


## Contributing
Any contributions to improve this software in any way are welcome. Below is a
check list that makes sure your contributions can be added as fast as
possible to tintX:

- [ ] Create a fork of [this repository](https://github.com/antarcticrainforest/tintX)
     and clone this fork (not the original code)
- [ ] Install the code in development mode: `python3 -m pip install -e .[dev]`
- [ ] Create a new branch in the forked repository `git checkout -b my-new-branch`
- [ ] Add your changes
- [ ] Make sure all tests are sill running. To do so run the following commands
    - tox
- [ ] Create a new pull request to the `main` branch of the
     [original repository](https://github.com/antarcticrainforest/tintX).
### Adding new Jupyter examples
You can add more examples to the
[docs/source documentation folder](https://github.com/antarcticrainforest/tintX/tree/main/docs/source).
Because notebooks are executed automatically by the unit tests GitHub workflow,
you should make sure that any additional dependencies imported in the notebook
are added to the `docs` section in the
[setup.py](https://github.com/antarcticrainforest/tintX/blob/main/setup.py).
All notebooks should be run with a kernel called `tintx` to install a new
kernel named `tintx` run the following command in the root directory
of the cloned repository:
```console
python -m ipykernel install --name tintx --display-name "tintX kernel"\
    --env DATA_FIELS $PWD/docs/source/_static/data --user
```
Make also sure to add additional link(s) to the
[notebook readme file](https://github.com/antarcticrainforest/tintX/blob/main/.Readme.ipynb).
