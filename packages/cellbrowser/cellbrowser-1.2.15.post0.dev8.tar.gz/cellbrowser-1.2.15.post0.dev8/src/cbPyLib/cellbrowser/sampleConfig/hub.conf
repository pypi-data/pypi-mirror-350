# default config file for the cbHub UCSC track hub generator

# required values
ucscDb = "hg38" # UCSC genome ID for the track hub
# One important part of hub making: resolve the gene identifiers to symbols
# We provide a lot of mappings on http://cells.ucsc.edu/downloads/cellbrowserData/genes/ 
# The necessary files will be automatically downloaded from there into ~/cellbrowserData on the first run
# You can use the command "cbGenes avail" to show all available identifier <-> symbol mapping tables
# For all gencode versions, "gencode-human" or "gencode-mouse" should work.
# Use the value "symbols" to just accept the gene identifer strings as they are
# Use "auto" to guess the type automatically 
geneIdType = "symbols"

# the second important part is the mapping of gene identifers or symbols to chromosome locations
# Example values are "gencode28" or "gencode35". They are BED6 (or more) .bed.gz files, in the format <db>.<geneModel>.bed.gz
# e.g. hg38.gencode28.bed.gz and we provide a lot of them on http://cells.ucsc.edu/downloads/cellbrowserData/genes/ 
# They will be automatically downloaded from there into ~/cellbrowserData. 
# Use 'cbGenes' to list, manage, re-create these files
geneModel = "gencode28"

# These settings will be important once you start publishing your hub
email = "user@university.edu" # track hubs should have a contact email address
hubUrl = "https://university.edu/hub.txt" # final URL of your track hub, used for the download links in the track docs pages

# these options do not need to be specified here, they default to the values specified in cellbrowser.conf 
# (located in the same directory as hub.conf) or the values specified on the command line.
