/*
 * The C source and header files are part of the Python package: NextRNGBook.
 * 
 * The core random number generator (RNG) is the 
 * 32-bit DX-k-s generator (for k <= KK, s = 1, 2 in this file) described in:
 *
 *     A system of high-dimensional, efficient, long-cycle and portable uniform random 
 *     number generators, Deng, Lih-Yuan et al., ACM Trans. Model. Comput. Simul., 2003.
 *     Available at: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/945511.945513
 * 
 * The implementation is based on the algorithm in the paper, 
 * with some variables and function names following the C code provided, but the code is 
 * independently written for this package.
 * 
 * The implementation was carried out by Chin-Tung Lin, 
 * with theoretical guidance and suggestions from Prof. Lih-Yuan Deng <lihdeng@memphis.edu>, 
 * Prof. Henry Horng-Shing Lu <henryhslu@nycu.edu.tw>, and Prof. Ching-Chi Yang <cyang3@memphis.edu>.
 *
 * The code structure has been adapted to follow the layout and design 
 * patterns of NumPy's and randomgen's RNG implementation, 
 * as described in their source code:
 * 
 *      Numpy: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/tree/main/numpy/random/src
 * 
 *      randomgen: https://github.com/bashtage/randomgen/tree/main/randomgen/src
 * 
 * For further details on the DX generator and related works, visit Prof. Deng's webpage:
