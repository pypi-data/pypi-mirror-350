## Installation

Install `samstacks` using pip:

```bash
# Recommended to install in a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install samstacks
```

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- [AWS SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/install-sam-cli.html) installed and configured (run `sam --version` to check).
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) configured with appropriate credentials (run `aws sts get-caller-identity` to check).

## Quick Start

1.  **Install `samstacks`** (see [Installation](#installation) above).

2.  **Create a manifest file** (e.g., `pipeline.yml`):

    ```yaml
    # pipeline.yml
    pipeline_name: MySimpleApp

    stacks:
      - id: backend
        dir: my_sam_app/backend/ # Path relative to this pipeline.yml
        params:
          TableName: MyTable
      
      - id: frontend
        dir: my_sam_app/frontend/
        params:
          ApiEndpoint: ${{ stacks.backend.outputs.ApiUrl }} # Example of output passing
    ```
    *(This is a minimal example. See [Manifest Reference](#manifest-reference) for all options.)*

3.  **Deploy the pipeline**:

    ```bash
    # Ensure environment variables used in the manifest (if any) are set
    # export MY_ENV_VAR=some_value

    samstacks deploy pipeline.yml
    ```

## Examples

Want a full working demo? Check out the [S3 Object Processor example](examples/simple-pipeline.yml) in the `examples/` directory. It showcases:
- S3 bucket with SQS notifications
- Lambda function processing uploaded files
- Stack output dependencies
- Templating for parameters and `samconfig.toml`
- Conditional deployment (`if`)
- Post-deployment testing scripts (`run`)

To try it (ensure AWS credentials and region are configured, and you are in the project root):
```bash
export ENVIRONMENT=dev
export PROJECT_NAME=samstacks-demo 
samstacks deploy examples/simple-pipeline.yml
```

## CLI Commands

### Deploy a Pipeline

```bash
samstacks deploy <manifest-file> [OPTIONS]
```

Deploys the stacks defined in the manifest file. SAM CLI's `sam deploy` output is streamed in real-time. 
By default, if SAM reports "No changes to deploy" for a stack, `samstacks` will automatically attempt to delete the resultant 'FAILED' changeset.

**Options**:
- `--region <region>`: Override the default AWS region.
- `--profile <profile>`: Override the default AWS CLI profile.
- `--auto-delete-failed`: Enables proactive cleanup. Before attempting to deploy a stack, this option will:
    1. Automatically delete the stack if it's found in `ROLLBACK_COMPLETE` state.
    2. Automatically delete any pre-existing 'FAILED' changesets for the stack that have the reason "No updates are to be performed."
- `--debug`: Enable debug logging.
- `--quiet`: Suppress all output except errors.

### Validate a Manifest

```bash
samstacks validate <manifest-file>
```
Validates the manifest file, checking syntax and ensuring stack directories exist.

## Manifest Reference

This tool uses a YAML manifest file (e.g., `pipeline.yml`) to define the pipeline of AWS SAM stacks to be deployed. The manifest allows for defining dependencies between stacks by piping outputs from one stack as parameters into another.

### Top-Level Structure

```yaml
pipeline_name: My SAM Application Deployment
pipeline_description: Deploys the backend and frontend for My SAM Application.

pipeline_settings: 
  # ... see below ...

stacks:
  - # ... see below ...
  - # ... see below ...
```

- **`pipeline_name`**: (String) The overall name for your deployment pipeline.
- **`pipeline_description`**: (String, Optional) A brief description of the pipeline's purpose.

### `pipeline_settings`

Global configurations that apply to all stacks in the pipeline, unless overridden at the stack level.

- **`stack_name_prefix`**: (String, Optional) A string prepended to each stack's `id` to form the CloudFormation stack name. Supports template substitution.
- **`stack_name_suffix`**: (String, Optional) A string appended after the stack `id` and any per-stack suffix. Supports template substitution.
- **`default_region`**: (String, Optional) Global AWS region for stack deployments. Can be overridden per stack or by the `--region` CLI option.
- **`default_profile`**: (String, Optional) Global AWS CLI profile for stack deployments. Can be overridden per stack or by the `--profile` CLI option.

### `stacks`

A list of SAM stack definitions to be processed sequentially. Each item in the list is an object with the following keys:

- **`id`**: (String, Required) A unique identifier for the stack within the pipeline. Used for output referencing (e.g., `${{ stacks.<id>.outputs.OutputName }}`) and forms the core of the CloudFormation stack name.
- **`name`**: (String, Optional) A human-readable name for logging and display. Does not affect the deployed CloudFormation stack name. Defaults to the `id` if not provided.
- **`description`**: (String, Optional) A description for the stack.
- **`dir`**: (String, Required) Path to the directory containing the stack's `template.yaml` (or `template.yml`), `samconfig.toml` (optional), and source code. **This path is resolved relative to the location of the manifest file itself.**
- **`stack_name_suffix`**: (String, Optional) A stack-specific suffix, appended after the `id` and before any global suffix.
- **`region`**: (String, Optional) Overrides global/default AWS region for this specific stack.
- **`profile`**: (String, Optional) Overrides global/default AWS profile for this specific stack.
- **`params`**: (Object, Optional) Key-value map of parameters for `sam deploy --parameter-overrides`. Values support template substitution.
- **`if`**: (String, Optional) A condition to determine if the stack should be deployed. Supports template substitution. If omitted, the stack is always processed. See "Conditional Stack Deployment" below.
- **`run`**: (String, Optional) A shell script (can be multi-line using `|`) executed after successful deployment and output retrieval for this stack. Supports template substitution. Runs in the stack's `dir`. See "Post-deployment Scripts" below.

### Templating in Manifest Values

Several fields in the manifest support template substitution using the `${{ <expression> }}` syntax.

1.  **Environment Variables**: `${{ env.VARIABLE_NAME }}`
    *   Substitutes the value of the environment variable `VARIABLE_NAME`.
    *   If the variable is not set, it's treated as `None` (which is falsy for the `||` operator).

2.  **Stack Outputs**: `${{ stacks.<source_stack_id>.outputs.<OutputName> }}`
    *   Substitutes the value of `<OutputName>` from the outputs of the stack identified by `<source_stack_id>` (which must have been deployed earlier in the pipeline).
    *   If the stack or the specific output is not found, it's treated as `None` (falsy for the `||` operator).

3.  **Default Value Fallback (`||`)**: The `||` operator can be used within an expression to provide a fallback value if the preceding part is falsy (e.g., an unset variable, an empty string from a resolved variable, or a non-existent stack output).
    *   Syntax: `${{ <expr1> || <expr2> || ... || 'literal_fallback' }}`
    *   It evaluates expressions from left to right and uses the first truthy (non-empty, resolved) value.
    *   **Literals**: String literals used as fallbacks **must be enclosed in single or double quotes** (e.g., `'default-value'`, `"another default"`).
    *   An empty string (`''` or `""`) from a resolved variable or as a literal fallback is considered falsy by `||`, meaning the next part of the chain will be evaluated.
    *   If all parts of a fallback chain are falsy, the expression resolves to the value of the *last* part in the chain. If the last part was an unresolvable variable/output (resolved to `None`), the final result is an empty string. If the last part was a literal empty string (`''`), the result is that empty string.

**Applicable fields for templating**: `pipeline_settings.stack_name_prefix`, `pipeline_settings.stack_name_suffix`, `stacks.params` values, `stacks.if` conditions, `stacks.run` script content, and `stacks.stack_name_suffix`.

### Execution Order and Stack Naming

- Stacks are deployed sequentially in the order they appear in the `stacks` list, provided their `if` condition (if present) evaluates to true.
- The actual CloudFormation stack name is constructed as: `[pipeline_settings.stack_name_prefix][stack.id][stack.stack_name_suffix][pipeline_settings.stack_name_suffix]`. Empty parts are omitted. 
  *(Example: `id: api`, global prefix `dev-`, stack suffix `-v2`, global suffix `-app` results in `dev-api-v2-app`)*
- This constructed name **always overrides** any `stack_name` defined in a stack's `samconfig.toml` when deploying via `samstacks`.

### `samconfig.toml` Preprocessing

`samstacks` supports preprocessing of `samconfig.toml` files found in a stack's `dir` before they are used by `sam build` and `sam deploy`.

- **Syntax**: `${{ env.VARIABLE_NAME }}` can be used within `samconfig.toml` values.
- **Behavior**: Placeholders are replaced with corresponding environment variable values. If an environment variable is not set, it will be replaced with an empty string.
- **Scope**: This templating is currently limited to `${{ env.VARIABLE_NAME }}`. It does **not** support `${{ stacks.<id>.outputs.<OutputName> }}` or the `||` fallback operator within `samconfig.toml` itself.
- **Use Case**: This allows for dynamic `samconfig.toml` settings (e.g., `s3_bucket`, `s3_prefix`, `image_repositories`, `tags`) based on the execution environment.

```toml
# Example: stacks/api/samconfig.toml
version = 0.1
[default.deploy.parameters]
  resolve_s3 = true
  s3_prefix = "${{ env.PROJECT_NAME }}/api-artifacts"
  capabilities = "CAPABILITY_IAM"
  region = "${{ env.AWS_TARGET_REGION }}" # Assumes AWS_TARGET_REGION is set
  tags = 'Project="${{ env.PROJECT_NAME || 'DefaultProject' }}" CostCenter="${{ env.COST_CENTER }}"'
```

### Conditional Stack Deployment (`if` field)

- Each stack definition can optionally include an `if: "<condition_string>"` field.
- The `<condition_string>` is processed using the templating engine (supporting `env` variables, `stack` outputs, and the `||` fallback operator).
- The stack is deployed if the final, substituted string evaluates to true (case-insensitive: `"true"`, `"1"`, `"yes"`, `"on"`).
- Otherwise, the stack is skipped, and its outputs will not be available for subsequent stacks.

### Post-deployment Scripts (`run` field)

- Each stack definition can optionally include a `run: "<shell_script_content>"` field.
- The script content is processed using the templating engine.
- It's executed after the stack has been successfully deployed and its outputs have been retrieved.
- The script runs with the stack's `dir` as its current working directory.
- A non-zero exit code from any command in the script will cause the `run` step to be considered failed, and the entire `samstacks` pipeline will halt.
- **Security Note**: Manifest files containing `run` scripts allow arbitrary shell command execution. Only use manifests from trusted sources.

### Automatic Cleanup of CloudFormation Artifacts

`samstacks` includes features to help manage CloudFormation artifacts automatically:

- **Default Behavior (Reactive Cleanup)**: If an attempt to deploy a stack with `sam deploy` results in SAM CLI reporting "No changes to deploy. Stack ... is up to date", `samstacks` will automatically try to delete the 'FAILED' changeset that SAM CLI creates in this specific situation. This helps keep the list of changesets for your stack clean.

- **`--auto-delete-failed` Flag (Proactive Cleanup)**: When you use this CLI flag, `samstacks` performs additional cleanup actions *before* attempting to deploy each stack:
    1.  **Deletes `ROLLBACK_COMPLETE` Stacks**: If a stack is found in the `ROLLBACK_COMPLETE` state (often indicating a failed initial creation with no resources provisioned), it will be deleted.
    2.  **Deletes Old "No Update" Changesets**: Any *pre-existing* 'FAILED' changesets associated with the stack that have the status reason "No updates are to be performed." will be deleted.

This combination helps maintain a cleaner CloudFormation environment, especially during iterative development.

## Troubleshooting / FAQ

- **Manifest Validation Errors:**
  - Ensure your YAML syntax is correct.
  - Check that all required fields (like `id` and `dir` for each stack) are present.
  - Verify that paths specified in `dir` exist relative to your manifest file.

- **Template Substitution Issues (`${{ ... }}`):**
  - **Unresolved `env` variables:** If `${{ env.MY_VAR }}` results in an empty string or an unexpected default, ensure `MY_VAR` is correctly set in your shell environment before running `samstacks`. The `||` operator can provide defaults: `${{ env.MY_VAR || 'default_value' }}`.
  - **Unresolved `stacks` outputs:** If `${{ stacks.some_stack.outputs.SomeOutput }}` is not working:
    - Confirm `some_stack` is defined *before* the current stack in the manifest.
    - Check that `some_stack` deployed successfully and actually produces `SomeOutput` (case-sensitive).
    - Ensure `some_stack` was not skipped due to an `if` condition.
  - **Literals in fallbacks**: Remember to quote string literals used with the `||` operator: `${{ env.VAR || 'this is a string' }}`.

- **`if:` Condition Not Behaving as Expected:**
  - The `if` condition evaluates the *final string value* after templating. For truthiness, it checks against `"true"`, `"1"`, `"yes"`, `"on"` (case-insensitive).
  - If you are checking an environment variable, ensure it's set to one of these values. For example, `if: ${{ env.SHOULD_DEPLOY || 'false' }}` means it deploys if `SHOULD_DEPLOY` is a truthy string, or defaults to not deploying if `SHOULD_DEPLOY` is unset/empty.

- **Stack in `ROLLBACK_COMPLETE`:**
  - This usually means the initial stack creation failed before any resources were provisioned. CloudFormation cannot update a stack in this state; it can only be deleted.
  - Use the `--auto-delete-failed` flag with `samstacks deploy` to automatically delete such stacks before retrying deployment.

- **"No updates are to be performed." FAILED Changesets Accumulating:**
  - `samstacks` automatically deletes the changeset created by SAM when it reports "No changes to deploy."
  - For older, similar FAILED changesets, use the `--auto-delete-failed` flag during deployment to clean them up proactively.

- **Path Resolution for `dir`:**
  - The `dir` specified for each stack in the manifest is always resolved *relative to the location of the manifest file itself*, not relative to where you run the `samstacks` command.

- **AWS Credentials or Region Issues:**
  - Ensure your AWS CLI is configured correctly (`aws configure` or environment variables like `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`).
  - You can specify region and profile via `pipeline_settings` in the manifest or via CLI options (`--region`, `--profile`).
