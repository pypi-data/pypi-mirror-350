## Requirements

* Installed version of [https://github.com/coder/code-server](https://github.com/coder/code-server)
  * If code-server is installed via Lmod: [Loading code-server using Lmod](#loading-code-server-using-lmod)
* `jupyter-server-proxy>=4.1.2`

## Installation

```
python3 -m pip install jupyter-code-server
```

## Configuration

### Setting the working directory

The environment variable `CODE_WORKING_DIRECTORY` is prioritised and can be changed for the VSCode Web IDE independently of the Jupyter working/notebook directory.

The order/priority is as follows:
1. `CODE_WORKING_DIRECTORY`, if not set:
2. `JUPYTERHUB_ROOT_DIR`, if not set:
3. `JUPYTER_SERVER_ROOT`, if not set:
4. `HOME`

### Using pre-started code-server

In case code-server is already running (e.g. started in sidecar container with Jupyter running in Kubernetes)
and servig either via TCP port or UNIX socket, it is possible to proxy this already running instance instead
of starting a new one with jupyter-server-proxy. Variables `JSP_CODE_SERVER_PORT` and `JSP_CODE_SERVER_SOCKET`
set `command` to empty list which makes `jupyter-server-proxy` pass requests to specified port of socket.

If running code-server is listening to TCP port, environment variable `JSP_CODE_SERVER_PORT` may be set to
port number.

If running code-server is listening to UNIX socket, environment variable `JSP_CODE_SERVER_SOCKET` may be set to
socket file path.

If none of these environment variables are set, jupyter-code-server starts new code-server process and proxies
requests to its socket.

### Enable/disable launcher

By default code-server launcher is enabled and visible in JupyterLab. Option `JSP_CODE_SERVER_LAUNCHER_DISABLED`
may be set to any non-empty value to disable launcher. This is useful when e.g. certain users are not supposed
to have code-server available in Jupyterhub as there is no easy way to disable loading of entire `jupyter-code-server`
module for these users if module is for example built into Docker image.

### Disable password login

By default, code-server is started with password authentication enabled.
To disable password login (e.g., for internal or trusted environments), set the environment variable `CODE_DISABLE_PASSWORD` to `true`.

### Loading code-server using Lmod

If code-server needs to be loaded from an Lmod environment you can set the `JSP_CODE_SERVER_LMOD_MODULE` variable to the path of the module.

Example: `JSP_CODE_SERVER_LMOD_MODULE=tools/code-server/4.22.1`

The module will then be loaded with the help of `LMOD_CMD` and `MODULEPATH` before the code-server is started.
