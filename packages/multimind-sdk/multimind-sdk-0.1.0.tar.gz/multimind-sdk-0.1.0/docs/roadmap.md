# 🧠 MultiMind SDK – Strategic Roadmap (2025)

A future-ready SDK for unified AI development, covering fine-tuning, RAG, agents, and enterprise-grade deployment.

## ✅ Phase 1 – Core Foundations (Completed)
- Unified API for LLM orchestration
- Initial support: OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, HF
- Prompt chaining, memory, LangChain adapter
- Lightweight agent orchestration (basic roles, tools)
- CLI + FastAPI interface

## 🚧 Phase 2 – In Progress (Q2 2025)
- [ ] **Role-based Agent Architecture** (plug-and-play, task-driven)
- [ ] **Extensible Tools Framework** (tool registration + execution)
- [ ] **Advanced Memory Interfaces** (Redis, Chroma, Chained Memory)
- [ ] **Multi-call Chaining & Prompt Management**
- [ ] **End-to-End RAG Pipeline** (ingestion, indexing, optimization)

## 🔜 Phase 3 – Target Q3 2025
- [ ] **Cognitive Loop Framework** (self-improving agents)
- [ ] **Zero/Low-Code YAML Pipeline Configs**
- [ ] **Hybrid Search with Vector + Knowledge Graph**
- [ ] **Multilingual + Multimodal Support (Whisper, BLIP, OCR)**
- [ ] **Agent Profiler Dashboard (logs, cost, metrics)**

## 🌐 Phase 4 – Enterprise & Edge Ready (Q4 2025)
- [ ] **Fine-Tuning Adapter Layer** (LoRA, QLoRA, PEFT workflows)
- [ ] **Secure RAG: GDPR Compliance, PII Redaction**
- [ ] **Edge Deployment Toolkit** (Jetson, Pi, Offline mode)
- [ ] **Plugin System: Slack, Notion, Salesforce connectors**
- [ ] **Unified Visual Dashboard + Debugger** (live state, replay, memory edit)

## 🧪 Phase 5 – Future Innovations (2026+)
- [ ] **Self-Tuning RAG Indexer** (auto-retrain with feedback)
- [ ] **Cross-Agent Communication (A2A, ReAct)**
- [ ] **Agent Marketplace Integration** (plug-n-play agents)
- [ ] **On-device Local Model Hub with Sync to Cloud**
- [ ] **Visual Agent Builder Interface (for devs + no-coders)**

## 🔎 Competitive Differentiators
- Unified pipeline for Fine-Tuning + RAG + Agents
- YAML-first, no-code + SDK support
- Built-in compliance, monitoring, cost-control
- SDK-level KG + vector hybrid retrieval
- Edge-to-cloud agent deployment
