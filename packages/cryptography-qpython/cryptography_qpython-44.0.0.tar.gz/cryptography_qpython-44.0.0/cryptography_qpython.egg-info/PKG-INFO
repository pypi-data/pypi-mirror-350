`cryptography` is a package which provides cryptographic recipes and primitives to Python developers. Our goal is for it to be your “cryptographic standard library”. It supports Python 3.7+ and PyPy3 7.3.11+.

`cryptography` includes both high level recipes and low level interfaces to common cryptographic algorithms such as symmetric ciphers, message digests, and key derivation functions. For example, to encrypt something with cryptography’s high level symmetric encryption recipe:

```py
>>> from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
>>> # Put this somewhere safe!
>>> key = Fernet.generate_key()
>>> f = Fernet(key)
>>> token = f.encrypt(b"A really secret message. Not for prying eyes.")
>>> token
b'...'
>>> f.decrypt(token)
b'A really secret message. Not for prying eyes.'
```
