## Completed subtasks

- [x] Set up project structure
- [x] Configure environment and dependencies

## In Progress subtasks

- [ ] Implement file discovery using glob patterns
- [ ] Develop core bundling logic
- [ ] Integrate template management
- [ ] Write initial documentation

## Future subtasks

- [ ] Add CLI interface for user interaction
- [ ] Implement plugin system for extensibility
