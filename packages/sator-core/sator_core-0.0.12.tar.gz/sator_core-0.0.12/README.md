# sator-core

This package contains the core domain logic for Sator, an open-source vulnerability analysis application. 
It encapsulates business rules, entity definitions, and use cases, ensuring a clean separation from infrastructure and 
external dependencies. By isolating the domain logic, the architecture remains modular, testable, and adaptable to 
different interface implementations.


## Installation

$ pip install sator-core
