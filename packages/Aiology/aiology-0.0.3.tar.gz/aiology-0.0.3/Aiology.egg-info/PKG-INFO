This part depends on your purpose ,for example :

### Using PDF module :

pdf_path = "YOUR_PDF_PATH"

#set up
pdf = PDF(pdf_path)
```

Then you can get your pdf content by using these two functions :
*get_pdf_content*
*get_pdf_page_content*

`get_pdf_content` -> extract all pdf pages content
`get_pdf_page_content` -> extract specific pdf page content

```Python
pdf.get_pdf_content() #will extract all pdf pages content
pdf.get_pdf_page_content() #will extract specific pdf page content
```

### Using AI module :
This module needs two parameters which is your *Gemini* api key , and use_for_telegram:

>
>True ,otherwise it's False as default 

```Python
#import our AI module
from Aiology import AI

#specify your Gemini api key
api_key = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"

#set up
ai = AI(api_key)
```

Then you can start communication by ai by these two functions :
*ask_question*
*ask_pdf_question*

`ask_question` -> Ask anything you want from Gemini by your api token
`ask_pdf_question` -> Ask about your pdf content from Gemini by your api token

```Python
#ask anything from ai
result = ai.ask_question("YOUR_TEXT_HERE")

#print ai answer
print(result)
```

If you want to ask ai questions about your pdf file ,you should pass `PDF` which is represents your pdf data to `ask_pdf_question` :

> NOTE :
>
> `ask_pdf_question` takes 3 arguments :
>
> text -> Your text
>
> pdf -> PDF object which represent your pdf data
>
> pdf_page -> You can define a specific pdf page for ai to answer to your questions

```Python
#import modules
from Aiology import PDF , AI

#variables
pdf_path = "YOUR_PDF_PATH"
api_key = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"

#PDF set up
pdf = PDF(pdf_path)

#Ai set up
ai = AI(api_key)

#ask about your pdf content
result = ai.ask_pdf_question("YOUR_TEXT",pdf,1)

#print result
print(result)
```

# What's new ?
Fixed some bugs

We add telegram bot usage option in PDf part

# Conclusion
This is a powerful ,but small ai package which provide you useful tools

I hope this will be useful for you
