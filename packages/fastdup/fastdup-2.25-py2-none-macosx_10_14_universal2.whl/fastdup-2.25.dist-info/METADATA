# Fastdup Tool
Copyright (C) 2024 by Dr. Amir Alush and Dr. Danny Bickson.

fastdup is a tool for gaining insights from a large image/video collection. It can find anomalies, duplicate and near duplicate images/videos, clusters of similarity, learn the normal behavior and temporal interactions between images/videos. It can be used for smart subsampling of a higher quality dataset, outlier removal, novelty detection of new information to be sent for tagging.

fastdup is:

* Unsupervised: fits any dataset
* Scalable : handles 400M images on a single machine
* Efficient: works on CPU only
* Low Cost: can process 12M images on a $1 cloud machine budget
