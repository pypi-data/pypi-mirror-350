This package provides a set of Python-based tools for Bayesian data analysis
which are simple to use, allowing them to applied quickly and easily.

Inference-tools is not a framework for Bayesian modelling (e.g. like [PyMC](https://docs.pymc.io/)),
but instead provides tools to sample from user-defined models using MCMC, and to analyse and visualise
the sampling results.

## Features

 - Implementations of MCMC algorithms like Gibbs sampling and Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo for 
 sampling from user-defined posterior distributions.
 
 - Density estimation and plotting tools for analysing and visualising inference results.
 
 - Gaussian-process regression and optimisation.
