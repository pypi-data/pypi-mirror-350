    # Reasoning: within the scope of an other hosted flask, modules have been
    # loaded, during which they could have accessed environment variables and
    # have stored their value locally, or simply got a reference to os.environ
    # and use that later on. This means that IF another hosted flask would reuse
    # them, the same environment variables would be used also. Since every
    # hosted flask should be configurable with their own variables in a fresh
    # environment, all modules should also be unloaded. Because we can't know
    # which modules have already accessed and cached variables, we need to
    # unload all of them. Due to other side-effects, like importing a class and
    # comparing objects to it, which might cause the "orginally" same class to
    # be different in two cases, some modules are excluded.
    
    # Warning: this approach is not fool proof. There can always be side-effects
    # that will mutually block. For now it holds ðŸ˜‡
