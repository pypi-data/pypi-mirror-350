[prep CDF-24745, CDF-24554, CDF-24555] ðŸ‘·Prepare dump refactoring. (#1588)

# Description

No change to the code that impacts the user. This is a prep commit to
reduce an upcoming refactoring of the dump method. The dump method takes
assets/time series and write them from CDF to csv/parquet. Then, it
needs to have the metadata keys of all assets/timeseries to know the
column headers.

This PR changes the metadata_key_counts to filter for data_set_id and
rootId such that it can be used in the dump method that needs this
filtering.

By accident found a bug. Forgot to set the limit properly. 

## Changelog

- [x] Patch
- [ ] Minor

### Improved

- [alpha] The command `cdf profile asset-centric` now checks the
metadata of all assets, events, timeseries, sequences, and files, not
just the first 1000.

## templates

No changes.
