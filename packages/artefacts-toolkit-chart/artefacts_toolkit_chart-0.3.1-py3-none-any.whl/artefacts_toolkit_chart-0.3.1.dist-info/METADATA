# Artefacts Toolkit (Charts)

_Please consider this as a pre-release package, and thus subject to large, and breaking, changes prior to v1_

A part of the Artefacts Toolkit, this package contains helpers to be used when creating charts from test data

Primarily designed to be used with Artefacts, the package can also be used standalone.

## Usage
```
from artefacts_toolkit_chart import make_chart

make_chart(
    filepath,
    topic_x,
    topic_y,
    field_unit=None,
    output_dir="output",
    chart_name="chart",
    file_type="rosbag",
):
```

_Note: Currently charts can only be created from rosbags_

Takes a file and creates a chart on the provided two topics. `"time"` can also be used as `topic_x` or `topic_y` if desired. An html chart will be created and saved to the `output_dir`.

### Plotting time when using rosbags

* Please note that not all ROS topics contain header timestamps. If no header is present, `make_chart` will use the rosbagâ€™s own timestamps, which may cause timing inaccuracies if the rosbag was recorded or played back at non-real-time speeds.


## Notes:

The Artefacts Toolkit also contains a `bag_recorder` helper to assist you if you require help in setting up a rosbag recording for your tests.

```
from artefacts_toolkit_rosbag.rosbag import get_bag_recorder
```

* When using in a virtual environment, you may need to add your site packages to `PYTHONPATH`

```
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/<your_workspace>/venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages
```
