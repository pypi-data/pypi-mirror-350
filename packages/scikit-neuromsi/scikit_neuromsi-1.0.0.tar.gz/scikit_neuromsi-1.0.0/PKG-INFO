**Scikit-NeuroMSI** is an open-source Python framework that simplifies the implementation of neurocomputational models of multisensory integration.

## Motivation

Research on the the neural process by which unisensory signals are combined to form a significantly different multisensory response has grown exponentially in the recent years. Nevertheless, there is as yet no unified theoretical approach to multisensory integration. We believe that building a framework for multisensory integration modelling would greatly contribute to originate a unifying theory that narrows the gap between neural and behavioural multisensory responses.

## Features

**Scikit-NeuroMSI** was designed to meet three fundamental requirements in the computational study of multisensory integration:

- **Modeling Standardization**: Standardized interface for implementing and analyzing different types of models. The package currently handles the following model families: Maximum Likelihood Estimation, Bayesian Causal Inference, and Neural Networks.

- **Data Processing Pipeline**: Multidimensional data processing across spatial dimensions (1D to 3D spatial coordinates), temporal sequences, and multiple sensory modalities (e.g., visual, auditory, touch).

- **Analysis Tools**: Integrated tools for parameter sweeping across model configurations, result visualisation and export, and statistical analysis of model outputs.

In addition, there is a **core** module with features to facilitate the implementation of new models of multisensory integration.

## Requirements

You need Python 3.10+ to run scikit-neuromsi.

## Installation

Run the following command:

        $ pip install scikit-neuromsi

or clone this repo and then inside the local directory execute:

        $ pip install -e .
