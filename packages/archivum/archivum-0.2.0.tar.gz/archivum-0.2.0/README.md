Latin for "archive".

PDF reference manager.

## Steps

1. Port Mendeley library


## Bibtex format

## Porting an Existing Mendeley Library

* References are BibTeX entries, creates  `ref_df`
* Part of a Mendeley bibtex entry is a field `file` that is a `;` separated list of a `:` list of `drive:path:suffix`. These paths may or may not exist, call them `vfiles` (virtual files, like a `Path` object to a file that DNE). These are extracted into `proto_ref_doc_df`, the prototype reference-document table.
* Separately we have documents corresponding to actual files, `afiles`, found by rgrepping the relevant Library directory 
* A reference can have zero or more corresponding `vfiles`
* Need to match `vfiles` to `afiles`. This is done with fuzzy name matching and the Levenshtein library to compute distance resulting in `best_match_df` from which we create `best_match_mapper`
* `ref_doc_df` then effects the remapping.
