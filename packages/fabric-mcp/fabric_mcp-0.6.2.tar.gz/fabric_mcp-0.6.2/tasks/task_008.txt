# Task ID: 8
# Title: Add Streaming Support to fabric_run_pattern
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Enhance the fabric_run_pattern tool to support streaming responses according to MCP streaming guidelines.
# Details:
1. Modify the fabric_run_pattern implementation to handle streaming responses from Fabric's /chat endpoint.
2. Implement the streaming protocol as defined in the MCP specification.
3. Ensure proper error handling during streaming (connection drops, timeouts, etc.).
4. Add configuration options to control streaming behavior (enable/disable, chunk size, etc.).
5. Maintain backward compatibility with non-streaming clients.

# Test Strategy:
Test streaming with various patterns and inputs. Verify that chunks are correctly streamed according to MCP specifications. Test error scenarios during streaming.
