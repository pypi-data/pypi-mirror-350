# Title: Implement fabric_get_pattern_details Tool
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the tool that retrieves detailed information about a specific Fabric pattern.
# Details:
1. Create the fabric_get_pattern_details tool implementation that accepts a pattern name.
2. Map to the Fabric /patterns/:name API endpoint.
3. Format the response to include the system prompt and any metadata associated with the pattern.
4. Handle cases where the requested pattern doesn't exist.
5. Structure the output to be easily consumable by MCP clients.

# Test Strategy:
Test with various pattern names, including both existing and non-existent patterns. Verify that all pattern details are correctly retrieved and formatted.
