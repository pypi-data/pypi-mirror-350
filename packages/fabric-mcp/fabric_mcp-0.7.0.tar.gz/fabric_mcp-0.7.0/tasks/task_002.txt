# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Core MCP Server Logic
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the foundation for the MCP server including connection handling and the list_tools() functionality.
# Details:
1. Implement the MCP server interface according to the 2025-03-26 specification.
2. Set up the basic server structure that can accept connections via the initial transport method (stdio).
3. Implement the list_tools() method that returns the available Fabric tools.
4. Create stubs for all the planned tools (fabric_list_patterns, fabric_run_pattern, etc.).
5. Implement basic error handling for connection and protocol issues.
6. Ensure the server can start up and respond to basic MCP requests.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for the server initialization and list_tools() functionality. Test that the server correctly advertises all the planned Fabric tools with appropriate descriptions.
