# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Additional Transport Layers
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: low
# Description: Add support for additional MCP transport mechanisms beyond the initial implementation.
# Details:
1. Research and implement WebSocket transport for MCP.
2. Ensure the server can handle multiple concurrent connections.
3. Implement proper connection lifecycle management (initialization, heartbeat, termination).
4. Add configuration options for transport-specific settings (port, max connections, etc.).
5. Maintain backward compatibility with the initial transport method.

# Test Strategy:
Test each transport mechanism individually. Verify that the server can handle multiple concurrent connections. Test connection lifecycle events.
