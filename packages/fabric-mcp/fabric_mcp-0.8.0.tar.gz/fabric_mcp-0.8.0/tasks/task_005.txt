# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Basic fabric_run_pattern Tool
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the core functionality of the fabric_run_pattern tool with basic text input/output (non-streaming).
# Details:
1. Create the fabric_run_pattern tool implementation that accepts a pattern name and input text.
2. Map the MCP tool parameters to the appropriate Fabric API request format for the /chat endpoint.
3. Implement the basic non-streaming version first, where the complete response is returned after processing.
4. Handle pattern execution errors and propagate them appropriately via MCP.
5. Ensure the tool correctly processes and returns the pattern output.

# Test Strategy:
Create tests with various patterns and inputs. Test both successful pattern execution and error scenarios. Verify the output matches what would be returned directly from Fabric.
