# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement fabric_list_patterns Tool
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the tool that lists available Fabric patterns by mapping to the Fabric /patterns API endpoint.
# Details:
1. Create the fabric_list_patterns tool implementation that calls the Fabric API client.
2. Map the response from Fabric's /patterns endpoint to the appropriate MCP tool response format.
3. Handle pagination if the Fabric API supports it.
4. Implement proper error handling and status reporting.
5. Format the pattern list in a user-friendly way that works well in MCP clients.

# Test Strategy:
Test the tool with both mock data and against a real Fabric instance. Verify that all patterns are correctly listed and formatted according to MCP specifications.
