# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance fabric_run_pattern to handle complex inputs like variables and attachments.
# Details:
1. Extend the fabric_run_pattern tool to accept variables as structured input.
2. Implement attachment handling according to MCP specifications.
3. Map these complex inputs to the appropriate format for Fabric's /chat API.
4. Add validation for input formats and provide clear error messages for invalid inputs.
5. Document the expected format for variables and attachments.

# Test Strategy:
Create tests with various combinations of variables and attachments. Test both valid and invalid inputs. Verify that complex inputs are correctly passed to Fabric and processed.
