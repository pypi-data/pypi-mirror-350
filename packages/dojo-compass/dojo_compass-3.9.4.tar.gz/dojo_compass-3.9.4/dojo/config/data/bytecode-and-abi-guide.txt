To deploy a new contract in Dojo, follow these steps:
1) Add its ABI in the relevant folder in /dojo/config/data/abis in JSON format.
2) Add its bytecode in the relevant folder in /dojo/config/data/bytecodes with the .bytecode extension.
3) Add an entry for this contract in /dojo/config/data/deployments.json

Old ABIs and bytecodes have been retrieved from Etherscan.

New ABIs and bytecodes for Aave local backend are retrieved from Hardhat. Here are the steps I took:
1) git clone https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-deploy.git
2) npx hardhat deploy
3) This compiles and deploys all contracts. Compiled contracts are located in the artifacts folder.
Go to any folder to view its JSON file which includes its ABI, bytecode and more information.
