EasyRemote Distributed Computing Nodes Module

This module provides the core distributed computing components for the EasyRemote
framework, including gateway servers, compute nodes, and client interfaces.

Components:
- DistributedComputingGateway: Central orchestration hub for distributed computing
- DistributedComputeNode: High-performance compute nodes with intelligent management
- DistributedComputingClient: Advanced client for remote function execution

Features:
- Production-grade reliability and performance
- Comprehensive monitoring and analytics
- Advanced load balancing and routing
- Enterprise security and compliance
- Horizontal scalability and clustering
