   |              ^^ Expression of type `array[int, n]` cannot be unpacked

Note: Unpacking of iterable types like `array[int, n]` is only allowed if the
number of items yielded by the iterator is statically known. Here, the number of
items `n` is generic and can change between different function invocations.
