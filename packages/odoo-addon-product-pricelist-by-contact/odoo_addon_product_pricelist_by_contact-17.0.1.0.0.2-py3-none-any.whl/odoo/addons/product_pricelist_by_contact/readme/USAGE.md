1.  Go to *Contacts* (you need to install module contacts for having
    this menu entry).
2.  Select one contact that is not the parent one.
3.  On the tab "Sales & Purchases", you will be able to select a
    different pricelist from its parent contact.
4.  If you change the pricelist in the parent contact, the pricelist of
    the children contacts will be overwritten with this one, no matter
    the previous value.
