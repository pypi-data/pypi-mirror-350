# Project अर्थ (Artha)

Code for `artha`.

```sh
pip install artha
```

## Development

I have tried to follow the best practices so things are much more sorted out. Here's a few commands that you should run in order to get started:

1. `make setup`: This will take care of installing `uv` and creating the virtual environment. I have used `uv` for this project.
2. `artha-cli serve`: This will start the server.
3. `make build_frontend`: This will build the react frontend and copy the files to the `artha/ui` folder.
