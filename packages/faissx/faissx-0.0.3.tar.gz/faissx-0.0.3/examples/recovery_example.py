"""
FAISSx Error Recovery and Reconnection Example

This example demonstrates how to use the error recovery and reconnection capabilities in FAISSx:
1. Configure error recovery with custom retry and backoff settings
2. Register callbacks for disconnection and reconnection events
3. Use the retry mechanism for operations
4. Handle server disconnections gracefully

These features make client applications more resilient to network issues and server restarts,
providing a more robust experience in production environments.
