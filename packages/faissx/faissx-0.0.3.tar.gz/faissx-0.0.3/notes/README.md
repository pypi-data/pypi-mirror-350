# FAISSx Development Notes

This directory contains future-oriented technical documentation and design plans for the FAISSx project.

## Contents

### Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)

- **prd-gpu-support.md** - Requirements and design for future GPU support implementation

## Purpose

These documents serve to:

1. **Guide Future Development** - Document planned features and improvements
2. **Record Design Decisions** - Capture architectural choices for future features
3. **Support Planning** - Provide detailed specifications for upcoming development work

## Note on Completed Work

Historical documentation for completed optimizations and features has been removed to keep this directory focused on future development. Completed work is documented through:

- Git commit history and PR descriptions
- Code comments and docstrings
- Test suites that validate implemented functionality
- The main project README and documentation

This keeps the notes directory lean and forward-looking, containing only active planning documents for upcoming features.
