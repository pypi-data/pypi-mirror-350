FAISSx client error recovery and reconnection module.

This module provides mechanisms for handling connection failures and automatically
reconnecting to the FAISSx server after network disruptions. It implements a robust
reconnection strategy with exponential backoff and jitter to handle temporary
network issues and server unavailability.

Architecture:
-------------
The recovery system consists of three main components:

1. Retry Mechanism: Functions wrapped with 'with_retry()' automatically retry on failure
   using exponential backoff with jitter to prevent thundering herd problem.

2. Connection Monitoring: A background thread periodically checks connection health
   by sending ping requests and triggers reconnection when disconnections are detected.

3. Reconnection Worker: A separate thread handles reconnection attempts with backoff,
   allowing the main application to continue functioning during recovery.

The module uses thread-safe state management with immutable configuration objects and
proper locking to ensure consistency across threads.

Usage:
------
# Configure recovery settings
configure_recovery(max_retries=3, initial_backoff=2.0)

# Register callbacks for connection events
on_reconnect(lambda: print("Reconnected!"))
on_disconnect(lambda: print("Disconnected!"))

# Retry operations automatically
result = retry_operation("search", query_vector, k=10)

# Manual recovery management (if needed)
if not is_connected():
    force_reconnect()

# Check recovery status
if is_recovering():
    print(f"Reconnection in progress. Attempts: {attempts_count()}")
