# lazy-b

Keep Slack, Microsoft Teams, or other similar applications from showing you as "away" or "inactive" by simulating key presses at regular intervals.

## Installation

Install directly from PyPI using pip or uv:

```bash
# Using pip
pip install lazy-b

# Using uv
uv pip install lazy-b
```

## Usage

### Command Line

Run `lazy-b` from the command line:

```bash
# Basic usage (will press Shift key every 1 second)
lazy-b

# Customize the interval (e.g., every 30 seconds)
lazy-b --interval 30
```

#### Platform-specific behavior

- **macOS**: By default, runs in background mode with no dock icon. You can close the terminal window after starting it, and it will continue to run.
- **Windows/Linux**: The application runs in the terminal window. You need to keep the window open for the program to continue running.

To stop lazy-b, you can:
- Press Ctrl+C in the terminal window
- On macOS, if running in background, find and kill the process:

```bash
# Find the process
ps aux | grep lazy-b

# Kill it using the PID
kill <PID>
```

### Python API

You can also use the Python API directly in your own scripts (works on all platforms):

```python
from lazy_b import LazyB
import time

# Create an instance with a custom interval (in seconds)
lazy = LazyB(interval=5)  # Press Shift every 5 seconds

# Define a callback function to handle status messages (optional)
def status_callback(message):
    print(f"Status: {message}")

# Start the simulation
lazy.start(callback=status_callback)

try:
    # Keep your script running
    while True:
        time.sleep(1)
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    # Stop on Ctrl+C
    lazy.stop()
```

## Features

- Prevents "away" or "inactive" status in messaging applications
- Customizable interval between key presses (default: 1 second)
- Simple command-line interface
- Cross-platform: Works on macOS, Windows, and Linux
- Background mode on macOS (no dock icon)
- Python API for integration into your own scripts
- Minimal resource usage

## Development

### Setup Development Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Lanznx/lazy-b.git
cd lazy-b

# Setup development environment
make dev-setup

# Install in development mode
make install
```

### Releasing New Versions

To release a new version:

```bash
# Update version, create commit and tag
make release  # This will prompt for the new version

# Push changes and tag to GitHub
git push origin main
git push origin v<version>  # e.g., git push origin v0.2.0
```

Pushing a tag will automatically trigger the release workflow, which will:
1. Build the package
2. Create a GitHub release
3. Publish to PyPI

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyAutoGUI
- PyObjC-Core (for macOS dock icon hiding, optional)
