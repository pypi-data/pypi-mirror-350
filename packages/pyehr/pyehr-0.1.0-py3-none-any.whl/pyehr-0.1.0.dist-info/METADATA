# PyEHR

This is a python package that can help researchers extract the cohort data from LARGE electronic health records (EHR). 

Now this package is currently under development. The developed function list below: 

1. `extract_from_file`:  extract data from a single file by specific values.
2. `extract_from_table`: extract data from a table (multiple files save in a folder) by specific values.
3. `extract_from_stata`: extract data from Stata files (multiple files save in a folder) by specific values.
