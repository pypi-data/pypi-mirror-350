# Robot Framework Alumnium Browser Plugin

This project provides an experimental **plugin for the Robot Framework Browser Library**, integrating features from the [Alumnium project](https://github.com/alumnium/alumnium).

Unlike the original Alumnium project, this plugin **does not expose a separate library**, but instead **extends the native Browser Library** with additional AI-assisted capabilities.  
This design ensures a seamless experience for users who already work with the Browser Library and want to leverage features of both technologies in the same test.

> üöß **Early-stage project:** This plugin is under active development. Feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Features

- AI-assisted browser automation using OpenAI (e.g. `Perform AI Task`)
- Fully compatible with existing Browser Library workflows (well... almost. Not sure about the handling of contexts)
- Declarative test writing: describe what you want to do, the plugin figures out the steps
- Extendable design using the [Browser Library plugin API](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-browser/blob/main/docs/PluginSupport.md)
