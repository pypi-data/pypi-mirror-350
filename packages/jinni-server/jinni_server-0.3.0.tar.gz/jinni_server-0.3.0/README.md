# Jinni Server Package

This package provides the `jinni-server` command-line entry point for the main `jinni` tool.

It allows running the Jinni MCP server via `uvx jinni-server` without needing to install the full `jinni` package first.

This package depends on the main `jinni` package, which contains the core functionality. Please refer to the main [jinni repository](https://github.com/smat-dev/jinni) for full documentation.
