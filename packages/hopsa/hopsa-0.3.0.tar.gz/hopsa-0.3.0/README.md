## Developer Guide

If you are new to using `nbdev` here are some useful pointers to get you
started.

# Install hopsa in Development mode

#### Using pip

Prefered method because `nbdev` assumes that you use `pip`.

``` sh
# make sure hop package is installed in development mode
$ pip install -e .

# make changes under nbs/ directory
# ...

# compile to have changes apply to hop
$ nbdev_prepare
```

#### Using uv

The package manager `uv` has many advantages over `pip`, but is not the
default for `nbdev`, so this approach might lead to some confusion.

Contrary to `pip`, `uv` installs the project in editable mode, such that
changes to the source code are immediately reflected in the environment.
`uv sync` and `uv run` both accept a `--no-editable` flag, which
instructs uv to install the project in non-editable mode.

``` sh
# make sure hop package is installed in development mode
$ uv sync

# make changes under nbs/ directory
# ...

# compile to have changes apply to hop
$ nbdev_prepare
```
