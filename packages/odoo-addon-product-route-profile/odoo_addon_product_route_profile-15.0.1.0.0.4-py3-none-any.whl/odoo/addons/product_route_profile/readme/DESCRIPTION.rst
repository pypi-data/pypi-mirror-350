This module replaces the initial concept of route_ids with a new concept of "route profile", coming with a company-specific and priority route profile.
route_profiles can be pre-defined trough the newly created route_profiles menu and applied to a product with one click. 
This is usefull in scenarios when one has multiple routes to apply to a product and want to prevent human errors.
