# CONTRIBUTING

Welcome â€” and thanks for taking the time to help improve the project!
This guide shows **exactly** what to run before you push code, how to keep CI green, and how to create a release.

---

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. **Format & lint**

   ```bash
   # Windows
   scripts\fmt.bat

   # macOS / Linux
   ./scripts/fmt.sh
   ```

2. **Run the tests**

   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

3. **Open a PR**
Make sure to associate your PR with an issue using `Fixes #<number>` in the description.

## ðŸ§ª Tests

* Use **pytest** for all tests.
* Keep unit tests fast and deterministic.
* Aim for high coverage on new modules.

---

## ðŸ”€ Commit & PR Workflow

```text
branch â†’ commit â†’ push â†’ CI â†’ PR review â†’ merge
```

* **Branch from `main`**; use flat, descriptive names (`add_login_api`, `fix_null_bug`).
* Make **small, focused PRs** with clear titles & descriptions.
* Link issues with `Fixes #<number>`.
* Run the Copilot code-review suite (if enabled) before opening the PR.
* CI must pass before merge.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Build & Release  (Maintainers Only)

### Local Build
One-liner: sets version, builds executables & wheels, uploads
<details>
<summary>Windows</summary>

```powershell
scripts\build_deploy_local.bat 0.1.0
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>macOS / Linux</summary>

```bash
./scripts/build_deploy_local.sh 0.1.0
```

</details>


### CI / GitHub Actions Release

1. **Tag & push**

   ```bash
   git tag v0.1.0
   git push origin v0.1.0
   ```

2. **GitHub Release**
   Creating a release from the tag triggers the workflow that builds and uploads the package (with the version derived from the tag).

### Versioning

* Versions are derived by **setuptools-scm** from git tags
* No need to modify `__version__` strings
