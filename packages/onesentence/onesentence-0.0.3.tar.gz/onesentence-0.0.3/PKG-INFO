A [Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hook for checking 'one sentence per line' documentation practices.

One sentence per line is a practice where developers use only one line per sentence.
This can make it easier to review or provide comments on in version control systems like `git`.
That said, it can sometimes be difficult to remember or "debug" this style preference.
We provide this linting tool to assist with finding and fixing areas of content where the style preference is one sentence per line.

## Usage

The `onesentence` tool provides a command-line interface for checking and fixing files to ensure they follow the "one sentence per line" rule.

#### Commands

```bash
  onesentence check <file_path>
```

This command checks if the specified file adheres to the "one sentence per line" rule. It will return a non-zero exit code if any violations are found.

```bash
  onesentence fix <file_path> [<dest_path>]
```

This command corrects the specified file by splitting lines with multiple sentences into separate lines. If a dest_path is provided, the corrected file will be written to that path; otherwise, the original file will be overwritten.

## Pre-commit

Install this pre-commit hook into your project with a block like the following:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/CU-DBMI/onesentence
    rev: v0.0.1
    hooks:
        # run checks
        - id: check
        # run checks and fixes where possible
        - id: fix
```
