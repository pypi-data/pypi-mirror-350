## 🚀 Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Initialize environment
$ pwnv init --ctfs-folder ~/CTF
$ source ~/CTF/.pwnvenv/bin/activate

# 2. Create a CTF
$ pwnv ctf add picoctf-2025

# 3. Add a challenge
$ pwnv challenge add warmup

# 4. Solve the challenge and submit
$ cd warmup
$ pwnv solve
```

## 🌐 Fetch from remote CTF

When adding a CTF, you'll have the option to connect to a remote server. If you choose to do so, `pwnv` will pull all challenges into your local workspace — including attachments — and store `.env` and `.session` files for future authenticated access. All of this is powered by [`ctfbridge`](https://pypi.org/project/ctfbridge).

pwnv init                 Initialize a new workspace (creates folders, installs deps)
