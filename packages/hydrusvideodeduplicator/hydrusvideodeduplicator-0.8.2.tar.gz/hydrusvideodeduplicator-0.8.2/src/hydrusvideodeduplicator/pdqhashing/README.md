# pdqhashing

Modified version of the Python implementation of PDQ by Meta.

## Tests

To get the test data, in this directory clone the ThreatExchange repo:

```sh
# pdqhashing/
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/facebook/ThreatExchange.git
```

This will also be automatically cloned when [pdq_test.py](./tests/pdq_test.py) tests are run, so you probably don't have to do this manually.

> Note: We only need one folder from this repo, `pdq/data`.
