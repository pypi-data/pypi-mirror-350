## [2.0.0] - 2025-05-23
### Added
- PDE:
  - TEM: Model Transverse Electro Magnetic Gaussian-Hermite modes
  - WaveFunc: Turn a desired function into a solution of the wave equation and animate it's propagation
  - OneD_WaveFunction: Solve the one dimensional Schr√∂dinger equation for a given potential
- Quantum:
  - GRAPE: Visualize the GRadient Ascend Pulse Engineering algorithm
  - Grover: Use Grovers algorithm to find desired values in a given array or list. (Warning, based on probability, could be wrong). Also can search for maximum and minimum values.
### Changed
