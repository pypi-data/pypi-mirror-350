# SystemAIR-API: Roadmap to Library Status

This document outlines the steps required to transform the SystemAIR-API project into a proper, well-structured Python library ready for integration with systems like Home Assistant.

## Core Library Structure

- [x] **Convert to proper package structure**
  - [x] Create a `setup.py` file with proper package metadata
  - [x] Add `pyproject.toml` for modern build system specification
  - [x] Create a core package namespace (e.g., `systemair_api`)
  - [x] Organize module imports to follow package structure

- [x] **Documentation improvements**
  - [x] Add docstrings to all classes and methods
  - [x] Generate API documentation using Sphinx
  - [x] Improve the README with installation instructions from PyPI
  - [x] Add more usage examples for common scenarios
  - [x] Create a contribution guide (CONTRIBUTING.md)

- [ ] **Quality assurance setup**
  - [x] Add type hints throughout the codebase
  - [x] Set up pre-commit hooks (linting, formatting)
  - [x] Configure mypy for static type checking
  - [x] Add more comprehensive error handling and logging
  - [x] Implement more robust validation for inputs

## API Refinements

- [x] **Error handling enhancements**
  - [x] Create custom exception classes for different error types
  - [x] Improve error reporting and diagnostics
  - [x] Add meaningful error messages for API issues

- [ ] **Authentication improvements**
  - [ ] Add token caching to reduce authentication overhead
  - [ ] Implement proper session management
  - [ ] Add support for credential storage in keyring

- [ ] **Command abstraction**
  - [ ] Create a higher-level command abstraction layer
  - [ ] Implement a full command set for all ventilation unit functions
  - [ ] Add command queueing and rate limiting for API protection

## Integration Readiness

- [ ] **Home Assistant specific changes**
  - [ ] Create a [Home Assistant integration](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/creating_integration_file_structure) structure
  - [ ] Implement entity models for Home Assistant
  - [ ] Add config flow for easy setup
  - [ ] Define services for controlling ventilation units
  - [ ] Create sensor entities for monitoring status

- [x] **Packaging and distribution**
  - [x] Fix PyPI compliance issues:
    - [x] Create a LICENSE file (MIT)
    - [x] Update setup.py to include long_description from README.md
    - [x] Add extras_require in setup.py for development dependencies
    - [x] Create a MANIFEST.in file
    - [x] Add project_urls to setup.py
    - [x] Separate dev dependencies into requirements-dev.txt
    - [x] Consider moving metadata to pyproject.toml (PEP 621)
    - [x] Implement single source of truth for version numbers
  - [ ] Publish the package to PyPI
  - [x] Set up automated releases with GitHub Actions
  - [x] Create a change log (CHANGELOG.md) following Keep a Changelog format
  - [x] Add version constraints for dependencies
  - [x] Implement semantic versioning

- [ ] **Async support**
  - [ ] Convert to asyncio for better integration with Home Assistant
  - [ ] Use aiohttp instead of requests for HTTP operations
  - [ ] Implement proper async WebSocket handling
  - [ ] Ensure all blocking operations are properly handled

## Testing Improvements

- [x] **Testing expansion**
  - [x] Increase test coverage to >85%
  - [ ] Add integration tests with recorded API responses
  - [ ] Implement system tests for Home Assistant integration
  - [ ] Add performance tests for critical operations

- [x] **CI/CD pipeline**
  - [x] Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing
  - [x] Add test coverage reporting
  - [x] Implement matrix testing across Python versions
  - [x] Add automated release workflow

## Community and Support

- [x] **Community building**
  - [x] Add issues templates for bug reports and feature requests
  - [ ] Create a discussion forum or Discord server
  - [x] Set up project roadmap with milestones
  - [ ] Publish documentation on Read the Docs

- [ ] **Examples and tutorials** (To be implemented later)
  - [ ] Create a cookbook with common usage patterns
  - [ ] Add example scripts for common use cases
  - [ ] Create tutorials for integration with various systems
  - [ ] Add a demo application showcasing the library

## Extended Features

- [ ] **Advanced features**
  - [ ] Implement data logging and history
  - [ ] Add support for firmware updates
  - [ ] Implement scheduled operations
  - [ ] Create device profiles for different ventilation unit models
  - [ ] Add support for multiple concurrent device connections

- [ ] **Webhook support**
  - [ ] Implement a webhook server for event notifications
  - [ ] Add event subscription capabilities
  - [ ] Create webhooks integration for Home Assistant

- [ ] **Performance optimizations**
  - [ ] Implement connection pooling
  - [ ] Add batch operations for multiple devices
  - [ ] Create caching strategies for frequently used data
  - [ ] Optimize WebSocket reconnection strategy
