def annualize_rets(r: torch.Tensor, periods_per_year: int = 252) -> torch.Tensor:
    """
    Calculates the annualized return of a return series by assuming the returns compound.
    :param r: Tensor of returns, typically daily or monthly returns.
    :param int periods_per_year: Number of periods in a year (default is 252 for daily returns).
    :return: Annualized return.
    :rtype: torch.Tensor

    Explanation: This function takes a series of periodic returns and annualizes them by
    compounding over the specified periods per year. It uses the formula:
    Annualized Return = (1 + Total Return)^(Periods per Year / Number of Periods) - 1

    Calculates the annualized volatility (standard deviation) of returns.

    :param int periods_per_year: Number of periods per year (252 by default for daily returns).
    :return: Annualized volatility.
    :rtype: torch.Tensor

    Explanation: This function computes the annualized standard deviation by multiplying the
    periodic standard deviation by the square root of the periods per year:
    Annualized Volatility = Periodic Std Dev * sqrt(Periods per Year)

def sharpe_ratio(r: torch.Tensor, riskfree_rate: float, periods_per_year: int = 252) -> torch.Tensor:
    """
    Computes the annualized Sharpe ratio of a return series.
    :param r: Tensor of returns.
    :param riskfree_rate: Annual risk-free rate as a decimal.
    :param int periods_per_year: Number of periods per year (default 252).
    :return: Sharpe ratio.
    :rtype: torch.Tensor

    Explanation: The Sharpe ratio measures the excess return (above risk-free rate) per unit
    of volatility. It uses annualized excess return divided by annualized volatility:
    Sharpe Ratio = Annualized Excess Return / Annualized Volatility

    :return: Sortino ratio.
    :rtype: torch.Tensor

    Explanation: The Sortino ratio is a variation of the Sharpe ratio focusing only on downside risk
    (negative returns). It uses semi-deviation for risk calculation instead of full volatility.

    :rtype: torch.Tensor

    Explanation: Tracking error quantifies the consistency of returns relative to a benchmark
    by calculating the standard deviation of the difference (r - ref).
