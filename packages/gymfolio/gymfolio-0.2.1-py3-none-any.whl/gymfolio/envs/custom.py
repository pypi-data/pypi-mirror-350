        Environment step method. Takes the agent's action and returns the new state, reward and whether or not the episode has finished.

        1. Compute the new weights based on the action taken.
        Depending on the agent, it can be either a full allocation to an instrument (`discrete`), 1-sum weights (`continuous`
        action space with long-only positions) or 0-sum weights (`continuous` action space with dollar-neutral positions).

        2. Compute the returns of the held, bought and sold positions.
        - Held positions return are computed as the price at last closing period divided by the initial open period.
        - Bought positions are bought at the Open. Return is the close by the open prices of that period.
        - Sold positions are sold at the Open. Return is the price at the open divided by the previous period close.

        3. Get the observation frame and expand if necessary. Transform into vector (1D), tile (2D) or tensor (3+D).

        4. Check if the episode has ended (truncated / terminated) and update the date tracker.

        5. Split the weights in held, bought and sold positions to compute the return series and append to the returns dataframe.
