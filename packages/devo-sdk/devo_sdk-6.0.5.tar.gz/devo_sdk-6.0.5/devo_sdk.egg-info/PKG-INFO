# Devo Python SDK

This is the SDK to access Devo directly from Python. It can be used to:

- Send events and files to Devo.
- Make queries.
- Manage deferred tasks.

> [!WARNING]  
> Right now the upload of lookups functionality is based on the `my.lookup.data` and `my.lookup.control` tables. 
> This method is deprecated on the Devo backend, and it will be discontinued on 1st January 2026.
> As an alternative, you can use the Lookups API: [Lookups API Documentation](https://docs.devo.com/space/latest/127500289/Lookups+API).
> There is a [developer guide](https://github.com/DevoInc/python-sdk/tree/master/docs/sender/api_lookup_guide.md) in documentation.

## Requirements

The Devo SDK for Python requires Python 3.9+

## Compatibility

- Tested compatibility for python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13

## Quick Start

### Installing the SDK

You can install the Devo SDK by using `easy_install` or `pip`:

```console
# option 1
easy_install devo-sdk

# option 2
pip install devo-sdk
```

You can use sources files, cloning the project too:

```console
# option 3
python setup.py install

# option 4
pip install .

# option 5 - dev option
pip install -e .
```

## Endpoints

### Sender

To send data with Devo SDK, first choose the required endpoint depending on the region your are accessing from:

| Region | Endpoint             | Port |
|--------|----------------------|------|
| USA    | collector-us.devo.io | 443  |
| Canada | collector-ca.devo.io | 443  |
| Europe | collector-eu.devo.io | 443  |
| APAC   | collector-ap.devo.io | 443  |

You have more information in the official documentation of Devo, [Sending data to Devo](https://docs.devo.com/space/latest/94652410/Sending%20data%20to%20Devo).

### API

To perform a request with API, first choose the required endpoint depending on the region your are accessing from:

| Region | Endpoint                               |
|--------|----------------------------------------|
| USA    | <https://apiv2-us.devo.com/search/query> |
| Canada | <https://apiv2-ca.devo.com/search/query> |
| Europe | <https://apiv2-eu.devo.com/search/query> |
| APAC   | <https://api-apac.devo.com/search/query> |

You have more information in the official documentation of Devo, [REST API](https://docs.devo.com/space/latest/95128275/Query%20API).

## Credentials

To obtain the access credentials necessary to use this SDK, you must have an account in [DEVO](https://www.devo.com/).

Check the [security credentials](https://docs.devo.com/space/latest/94763701/Security%20credentials) info for more details.

### Certificates

You need use a three files (Cert, key and chain) to secure send data to Devo.
Administrator users can find them in **Administration** → **Credentials**, in the X.509 tab.

### API authorization

You can use a domain API key and API secret to sign the request. These are are a pair of credentials that every
Devo account owns. Administrator users can find them in **Administration** → **Credentials**, in the Access Keys tab.

## Launch tests

### Pytest

The SDK uses Pytest for testing. This is a powerful tool for testing Python code. Pytest is a much more flexible and powerful tool than the built-in unittest module. It allows more testing functionality through the use of plugins. You can find more information in the [Pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/).

Install the testing requirements:

```console
pip install -r requirements-test.txt
```

You can run tests from the `tests` folder of SDK

```console
pytest
```

Its normal that TCP tests fails in clients or not Devo developers systems.

You can add the option `--cov` to create a coverage report.

```console
pytest --cov
```

Check the [pytest-cov documentation](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/) for more details.

The tests are divided into unit and integration tests. The integration tests require either a connection to Devo or to a local server that is launched when testing, so you need to have the environment variables in your system for all the tests that require connection to Devo can work.

To run the unit tests only, you can use the `unit` folder:

```console
pytest unit
```

To run the integration tests only, you can use the `integration` folder:

```console
pytest integration
```

You can also run the test for just one module. This is a useful feature if you are developing functionality in just one module.

```console
pytest unit/test_sender_encoding.py
```
