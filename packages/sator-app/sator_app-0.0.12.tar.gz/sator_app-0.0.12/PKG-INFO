# sator-app

This package contains the Application Layer for Sator, responsible for orchestrating and managing use cases and 
workflows. It acts as a bridge between the domain logic and external interfaces, ensuring that business processes are 
executed correctly while maintaining a clean separation of concerns. This layer coordinates interactions between the 
domain, infrastructure, and presentation layers without containing business rules itself.

## Installation

```shell
$ pip install sator-app
```
