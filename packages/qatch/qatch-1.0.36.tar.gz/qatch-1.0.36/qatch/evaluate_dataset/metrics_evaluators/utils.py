    """Transforms the input value into a tuple for consistent comparison.

    This method is primarily used as a key function for Python's built-in sorting.
    It transforms the raw input into a tuple that can be used for comparison across various types.
    None values are treated as smallest, followed by numerical types, and then all other types are converted to strings.

    Args:
        x : Variable of any data type.
            The data that needs to be transformed for sorting.

    Returns:
        tuple: A two-element tuple that consists of a priority indicator (int) and a transformed value (float or str).

    Note:
        - None is treated as smallest and assigned a priority of 0.
        - Numerical types (int and float) are assigned a priority of 1 and are uniformly represented as float.
        - All other types are converted to string and assigned a priority of 2.
        - This makes it possible to sort a list containing diverse types of elements.
