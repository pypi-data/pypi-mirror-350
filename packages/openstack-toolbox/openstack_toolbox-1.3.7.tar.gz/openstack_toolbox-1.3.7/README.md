## Important Note: SMTP Configuration with Gmail

Google now requires secure authentication via **OAuth 2.0** or the use of an **App Password** (if two-step verification is enabled) for SMTP access.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Without this, email sending will fail.**

- For detailed info, visit the official Google guide:  
  https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833

- To create an App Password, follow this guide:  
  https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833#app-passwords

**Tip:** Enable two-step verification and create an App Password to use Gmail SMTP with this project.
