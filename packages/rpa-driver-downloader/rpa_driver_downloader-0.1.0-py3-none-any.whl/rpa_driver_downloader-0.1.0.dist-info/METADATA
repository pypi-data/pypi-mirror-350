# ⚠️ This library is currently compatible with Python versions up to 3.11.  
Python 3.12+ is not supported due to `requests` dependency using the removed `cgi` module.

# 🧩 rpa-driver-downloader

**rpa-driver-downloader** is a lightweight Python package that automatically downloads and manages the latest WebDriver binaries (Gecko, Chromium, Edge) for browser automation using **Selenium**, **BotCity**, or any other RPA tool.

Whether you're automating browsers on Linux, Windows, or macOS, this library ensures that the required driver is downloaded and ready to use — with just one line of code.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Automatic download of GeckoDriver, ChromeDriver, and EdgeDriver
- 📦 Stores drivers locally inside a `/drivers/` folder
- 🔐 Saves driver paths in `settings.json` for reuse
- 🧠 Automatically detects your OS and architecture
- 🔄 Returns absolute path to use with Selenium or BotCity
- 🧪 Works well with testing and RPA environments



## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install rpa-driver-downloader
```


## ⚙️ Usage

```bash
from rpa_driver_downloader import Gecko, Chromium, Edge

gecko_path = Gecko().path_for_the_driver()
chrome_path = Chromium().path_for_the_driver()
edge_path = Edge().path_for_the_driver()
```


## Example: Using with Selenium

```bash
from selenium import webdriver
from rpa_driver_downloader import Gecko

driver = webdriver.Firefox(executable_path=Gecko().path_for_the_driver())
driver.get("https://example.com")
```


## Example: Using with BotCity

```bash
from botcity.web import BotFirefox
from rpa_driver_downloader import Gecko

bot = BotFirefox(driver_path=Gecko().path_for_the_driver())
bot.browse("https://www.google.com")
```
