* Added support for automatic refreshing of access tokens, which
  is required for security. This involves adding
  `uaa_client.middleware.UaaRefreshMiddleware` to your
  middleware setting, after Django's session and authentication
  middleware. For more details, see the quick start guide.

* The example app now supports an optional `settings_local.py`,
  so it's easy to e.g. connect to the real cloud.gov for manual
  testing.
