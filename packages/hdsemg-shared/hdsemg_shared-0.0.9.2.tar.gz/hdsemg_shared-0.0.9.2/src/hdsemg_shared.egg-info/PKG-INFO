# hdsemg-shared

Reusable Python components and utilities for working with high-density surface EMG (HD-sEMG) data.

This module contains shared logic used across multiple related projects, such as `hdsemg-pipe` and `hdsemg-select`. It is installable as a standalone Python package.

## ðŸ§ª Local Development

If you're actively developing or testing the module locally, you can install it in editable mode:

```bash
cd path/to/hdsemg-pipe/src/shared_logic
pip install -e .
```

This will allow you to make code changes without reinstalling the package.

## ðŸ§° Requirements

This module requires:

- Python â‰¥ 3.7
