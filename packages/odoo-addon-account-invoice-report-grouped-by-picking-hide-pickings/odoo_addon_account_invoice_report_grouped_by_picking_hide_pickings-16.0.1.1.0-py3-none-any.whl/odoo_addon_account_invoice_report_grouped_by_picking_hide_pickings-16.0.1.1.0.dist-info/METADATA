Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

1. Go to Invoicing / Configuration / Settings. Then search for the
   "Account Invoice Report Grouped By Pickings" section
2. Edit the "Default Hide Return Pickings" or the "Update Qty Hiding
   Pickings if necessary"

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

1. Generate a sales order with a confirmed delivery that needs some
   correction.
2. Go to a delivery picking form.
3. Click the return button, mark the 'is internal return check', and
   make a full return. If you dont return all the moves of the picking,
   an error will be shown.
4. Edit the sales order, and generate a correct final delivery
5. Generate the invoice of the sales order, and print its report. See
   how the first picking and its return doesn't appear.
6. In addition, you can manually choose whose stock pickings you want to
   hide going to: Picking Form / Additional Info / Hide on Invoice.
   Remember that the selected pickings will be hidden but the total
   amount of the report won't be changed, the base module adds the
   remaning quantities as lines without picking.
