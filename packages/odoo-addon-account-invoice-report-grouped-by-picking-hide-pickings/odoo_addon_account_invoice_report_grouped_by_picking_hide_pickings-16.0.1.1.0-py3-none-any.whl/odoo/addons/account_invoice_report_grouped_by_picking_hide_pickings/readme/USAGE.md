To use this module, you need to:

1. Generate a sales order with a confirmed delivery that needs some correction.
2. Go to a delivery picking form.
3. Click the return button, mark the 'is internal return check', and make a full return. If you dont return all the moves of the picking, an error will be shown.
4. Edit the sales order, and generate a correct final delivery
5. Generate the invoice of the sales order, and print its report. See how the first picking and its return doesn't appear.
6. In addition, you can manually choose whose stock pickings you want to hide going to: Picking Form / Additional Info / Hide on Invoice. Remember that the selected pickings will be hidden but the total amount of the report won't be changed, the base module adds the remaning quantities as lines without picking.
