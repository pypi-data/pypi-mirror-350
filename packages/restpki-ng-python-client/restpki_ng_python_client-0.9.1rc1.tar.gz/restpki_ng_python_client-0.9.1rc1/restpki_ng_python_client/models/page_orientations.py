    <b><i>Para Português, <a href=\"https://docs.lacunasoftware.com/pt-br/articles/rest-pki/core/integration/get-started\">clique aqui</a></i></b>  <p>   <a href=\"https://docs.lacunasoftware.com/en-us/articles/rest-pki/core/\">Rest PKI Core</a> is an upcoming version of   <a href=\"https://docs.lacunasoftware.com/en-us/articles/rest-pki/\">Rest PKI</a> that will have extended compatibility with environments and databases.  </p>  <p>   In addition to Windows Server (which is already supported by Rest PKI), Rest PKI Core will also run on <b>Linux</b> (Debian- and RedHat-based distributions)   and on <b>Docker</b>. As for database servers, in addition to SQL Server, <b>PostgreSQL</b> will also be supported.  </p>  <p>   <b>Before getting started, see the integration overview on the <a href=\"https://docs.lacunasoftware.com/en-us/articles/rest-pki/core/integration/\">Integration Guide</a></b>  </p>  <p>   For questions regarding the usage of this API, please reach us at <a href=\"https://lacuna.help/\">lacuna.help</a>  </p>    <h2>Parameters</h2>  <p>   You will need the following parameters:  </p>  <ul>   <li><b>Endpoint</b>: address of the Rest PKI Core instance that will be used</li>   <li><b>API Key</b>: authorization key for using the API</li>  </ul>  <p>   The <span class=\"model\">endpoint</span> must be prefixed to all relative URLs mentioned here.
