``Learnware`` Documentation
============================================================

The ``learnware`` package provides a fundamental implementation of the central concepts and procedures and encompasses all processes within the *learnware paradigm*,
including the submitting, usability testing, organization, identification, deployment and reuse of learnwares.
Its well-structured design ensures high scalability and facilitates the seamless integration of additional features and techniques in the future.
In addition, the ``learnware`` package serves as the core engine for the `Beimingwu System <https://bmwu.cloud>`_, which supports the computational and algorithmic aspects of ``Beimingwu`` 
and offers rich algorithmic interfaces for learnware-related tasks and research experiments.
