Example Arrays
==============
Darr arrays consist of a folder (here with a '.darr' suffix) containing a raw,
headerless binary file, one or two JSON text files (depending on presence of
metadata) and a README text file with documentation and code for reading the
array in a variety of languages.

Examples are provided for all numeric types that Darr/NumPy supports, and for
1D and 2D arrays. But being based on NumPy, Darr supports N-dimensional arrays.
