Examples
========
Examples are provided here of both regular and ragged ragged arrays. Browse the
`array <arrays>`__ and `ragged array <raggedarrays>`__ folders containing these
arrays (which themselves are the folders with a '.darr' suffix) to see how easy
it is to get a sense of the data that is represented, and how it can be read.
Examples are provided for all numeric types, and for 1D and 2D arrays. But
being based on NumPy, Darr supports N-dimensional arrays.
