# Myrtle
A [real-time](#real-time) reinforcement learning workbench
that helps you connect worlds with agents, allowing for
[multiple and intermittent rewards](#multiple-and-intermittent-rewards).

Myrtle connects a real-time environment with an agent and runs them.

```
or in a script
```python
import myrtle.demo
myrtle.demo.run_demo()
```
an on-screen message will prompt you to follow the run in your
your browser at
[`http://127.0.0.1:7777/bench.html`](http://127.0.0.1:7777/bench.html).

To run a RL agent against a world

```python
from myrtle import bench
bench.run(AgentClass, WorldClass)
```

For example, to run a Random Single Action agent with a Stationary Multi-armed Bandit

```python
from myrtle import bench
from myrtle.agents.random_single_action import RandomSingleAction
from myrtle.worlds.stationary_bandit import StationaryBandit
bench.run(RandomSingleAction, StationaryBandit)
```

```

The `run()` function in `bench.py` is the entry point.

Run the unit test suite with `pytest`. These typically run in less than
60 seconds.

```bash
uv run pytest
```

Run the integration tests by using pytest on a file it doesn't usually
gather from, `integration_test_suite.py`. This takes a few hours to
run.
```bash
uv run pytest -s src/myrtle/tests/integration_test_suite.py
```

# Worlds

To be compatible with the Myrtle benchmark framework,
world classes have to have a few
characteristics. There is a skeleton implementation in
[`base_world.py`](base_world.py)
to use as a starting place. 

## Attributes

- `n_sensors`: `int`, a member variable with the number of sensors, the size of
the array that the world will be providing each iteration.
- `n_actions`: `int`, a member variable with the number of actions, the size of
the array that the world will be expecting each iteration.
- `n_rewards (optional)`: `int`, a member variable with
the number of rewards, the length of
the reward list that the world will be providing each iteration. If not provided,
it is assumed to be the traditional 1.
- `name`: `str`, an identifier so that the history of runs on this world can be
displayed together and compared against each other.

### Multiple and intermittent rewards

Having the possibility of more than one reward is a departure
from the typical RL problem formulation and, as far as I know,
unique to this framework. It allows for intermittent rewards, that is,
it allows for individual rewards to be missing on any given time step.
See page 10 of [this paper](https://brandonrohrer.com/cartographer) for
a bit more context

## Real-time

A good world for benchmarking with Myrtle will be tied to a wall clock
in some way. In a perfect world, there is physical hardware involved.
But this is expensive and time consuming, so more often it is a simulation
of some sort. A good way to tie this to the wall clock is with a
pacemaker that advances the simluation step by step at a fixed cadence.
There exists such a thing in the
[`pacemaker` package](https://github.com/brohrer/pacemaker), which
is built into the `BaseWorld`.

## `BaseWorld`

There is a base implementation of a world you can use as a foundation for writing
your own. Import and extend the `BaseWorld` class.

```python
from myrtle.worlds.base_world import BaseWorld

class MyWorld(BaseWorld):
    ...
```

It takes care of the interface with the rest of the benchmarking platform,
including process management, communication, and logging.
To make it your own, override the `__init__()`, `reset()`, `step_world()`
and `sense()` methods.

## Stock Worlds

In addition to the base world there is a very short, but growing list of sample
worlds that come with Myrtle. They are useful for developing, debugging,
and benchmarking new agents.

- Stationary Bandit  
`from myrtle.worlds.stationary_bandit import StationaryBandit`  
A multi-armed bandit where each arm has a different maximum payout and a different
expected payout.

- Non-stationary Bandit  
`from myrtle.worlds.nonstationary_bandit import NonStationaryBandit`  
A multi-armed bandit where each arm has a different maximum payout and a different
expected payout, and after a number of time steps the max and expected payouts change
for all arms.

- Intermittent-reward Bandit  
`from myrtle.worlds.intermittent_reward_bandit import IntermittentRewardBandit`  
A stationary multi-armed bandit where each arm 
reports its reward individually but with intermittent outages.

- Contextual Bandit  
`from myrtle.worlds.contextual_bandit import ContextualBandit`  
A multi-armed bandit where the order of the arms is shuffled at each time step,
but the order of the arms is reported in the sensor array.

- One Hot Contextual Bandit  
`from myrtle.worlds.one_hot_contextual_bandit import OneHotContextualBandit`  
Just like the Contextual Bandit, except that the order of the arms is
reported in a concatenation of one-hot arrays.


# Agents

An Agent class has a few defining characteristics. For an example of how
these can be implemented, check out
[`base_agent.py`](https://codeberg.org/brohrer/myrtle/src/branch/main/src/myrtle/agents/base_agent.py).

## Initialization
An Agent initializes with at least these named arguments,

- `n_sensors`: `int`
- `n_actions`: `int`
- `n_rewards (optional)`: `int`

## Other attributes
The only other attribute an Agent is expected to have is a name.

- `name`: `str`, an identifier so that the history of runs with this agent can be
displayed together and compared against each other.

## `BaseAgent`

There is a base implementation of an agent you can use as a foundation for writing
your own. Import and extend the `BaseAgent` class.

```python
from myrtle.agents.base_agent import BaseAgent

class MyAgent(BaseAgent):
    ...
```

It takes care of the interface with the rest of the benchmarking platform,
including process management, communication, and logging.
To make it your own, override the `__init__()`, `reset()`,
and `choose_action()` methods.

## Agents included

As of this writing there is a short list of agents that come with Myrtle.
These aren't intended to be very sophisticated, but they are useful for 
providing performance baselines, and they serve as examples of how to
effectively extend the `BaseAgent`.

- Random Single Action  
```from myrtle.agents.random_single_action import RandomSingleAction```  
An agent that selects one action at random each time step.

- Random Multi Action  
```from myrtle.agents.random_multi_action import RandomMultiAction```  
An agent that will randomly select one or more actions at each time step,
or none at all.

- Greedy, State-blind  
```from myrtle.agents.greedy_state_blind import GreedyStateBlind```  
An agent that will always select the action with the highest expected return.

- Greedy, State-blind, with epsilon-greedy exploration  
```from myrtle.agents.greedy_state_blind_eps import GreedyStateBlindEpsilon```  
An agent that will select the action with the highest expected return
most of the time. The rest of the time it will select a single action at random.

- Q-Learning , with epsilon-greedy exploration  
```from myrtle.agents.q_learning_eps import QLearningEpsilon```  
The classic tabular learning algorithm.
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning)

- Q-Learning , with curiosity-driven exploration  
```from myrtle.agents.q_learning_curiosity import QLearningCuriosity```  
Q-Learning, but with some home-rolled curiosity-driven exploration.

## Messaging

Communication between the Agent and the World is conducted through
a message queue, specifically [dsmq](https://www.brandonrohrer.com/dsmq).
A dsmq server is set up by `bench.py` and both `base_world.py` and
`base_agent.py` set up client connections. Through these connections they
pass sensor, action, and reward information. A client adds a message to
a topic in the dsmq with a line like
```python
mq_connection.put(topic, message)
```
where both `topic` and `message` are strings. Myrtle makes frequent use of
`json.dumps()` and `json.loads()` to convert dictionaries to strings
and send them as messages. It can retreive the oldest unread message
in a topic with
```python
mq_connection.get(topic)
```

The current version of myrtle makes use of three topics (but arbitrarily
many more can be used if necessary), `"agent_step"`, `"world_step"`,
and `"command"`.

In `world_step` messages are stringified dicts containing four key-value pairs.
- `"loop_step"`, the current time step for the sense-act-reward loop.
This is distinct from `world_step`, used for counting
internal simulation time steps.
- `"episode"`, how many episodes have completed already.
- `"sensors"`, the current set of sensor values.
- `"rewards"`, the current set of reward values.

In `agent_step` messages are stringified dicts containing
- `"episode"`, should match that of the world.
- `"step"`, should match the loop step of the world.
- `"timestamp"`, the wall clock time the message was sent.
- `"actions"`, the current set of actions commanded.

There is also a program `"control"` topic, for signaling the end of an
episode or that it is time to shut down the run.
Following the conventions of [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym),
there are `"truncated"` and `"terminated"`.

The IP address and port number of the message queue can be changed in
[`config.toml`](https://codeberg.org/brohrer/myrtle/src/branch/main/src/myrtle/config.toml)
as needed.

## Monitoring

The reward collected by the agent can be observed through your browser in
[a monitoring animation](http://127.0.0.1:7777/bench.html).

Animations are written in Javascript and there are a couple of examples
[in the `monitors` directory](https://codeberg.org/brohrer/myrtle/src/branch/main/src/myrtle/monitors) if you want to build your own.

The IP address and port number of the web server can be changed in
[`config.toml`](https://codeberg.org/brohrer/myrtle/src/branch/main/src/myrtle/config.toml)
as needed.

## Multiprocess coordination

One bit of weirdness about having the World and Agent running in separate
processes is how to handle flow control. The way myrtle handles this is that
the World is always to the wall clock,
advancing on a fixed cadence. It will keep providing sensor and reward
information without regard for whether the Agent is ready for it.
It will keep trying to do the next thing, regardless of whether the Agent
has had enough time to decide what action to supply. The World
does not accommodate the Agent. The responsibility for keeping up falls
entirely on the Agent.

This means that the Agent must be able to handle the case where
the World has provided multiple sensor/reward updates since
the previous iteration. It also means that the World must be prepared to have 
one, zero, or multiple action commands from the Agent.

## Saving and reporting results

If the bench is run with argument `log_to_db=True` (the default) then,
the total reward for every time step reported by the World is written
to a [SQLite database](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html),
stored locally in a database file called `bench.db`.

Reporting and visualization scripts can be written that pull from these results.
