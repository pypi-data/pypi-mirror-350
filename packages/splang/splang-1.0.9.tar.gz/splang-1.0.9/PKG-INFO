# splang

**splang** is an esoteric programming language written in the form of a playlist. A writeup of the language can be found in the [splang documentation](https://satish.dev/projects/splang/).

Programs, or splangs, are playlists whose track metadata encode operations. Take a look at the [splang helloworld](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7cPsICy0U7WM8Q67SuYXds?si=c292b92145604f56) for a sample splang playlist. Use the splang interpreter to execute these playlists programmatically.

The most convenient way to run splang code is by creating a Spotify playlist and using a developer token. Refer to the [Spotify API documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) and [Spotipy API documentation](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for environment setup. However, you can also run splang code using a local JSON file that contains the playlist data.

## 🛠️ Installation and Use

### 📦 Development Setup

To get started with development, clone the [splang repository](https://github.com/NamanSatish/splang) and set up your environment:

Ensure Python **>=3.11+** is installed. It's recommended to use a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

This installs the project in editable mode along with development tools like `pytest`.

### 🚀 General Setup

To install splang for general use, you can install it directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install splang
```

#### ▶️ Run with Spotify developer access:

```bash
splang
```

Ensure you have a valid Spotify developer token set up in your environment, i.e export `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID`, `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI` as per the Spotipy documentation.

#### ▶️ Run with a local playlist file:

```bash
splang helloworld.json
```

#### ▶️ Run the example helloworld:

```bash
splang -hello
```

#### ▶️ Run the example fibonacci:

```bash
splang -fib
```
