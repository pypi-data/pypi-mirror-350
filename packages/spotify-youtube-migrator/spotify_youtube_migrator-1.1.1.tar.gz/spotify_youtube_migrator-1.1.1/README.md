## Quick Start üöÄ

### Step 1: Get Your Authentication Tokens

Before migrating playlists, you need to obtain authentication tokens:

```bash
migrate-playlist auth setup
```

This will:
1. Display setup instructions
2. Optionally open the authentication website: `https://youtube-spotify-token-finder.vercel.app`

### Step 2: Authenticate with Both Services

Visit the authentication website and:
1. Click **"Login with Spotify"** and authorize the application
2. Click **"Login with YouTube Music"** and authorize the application  
3. Copy the generated access tokens (just the token strings, not the full JSON)

### Step 3: Save Your Tokens

Set your Spotify token:
```bash
migrate-playlist set-token --spotify --token "YOUR_SPOTIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

Set your YouTube Music token:
```bash
migrate-playlist set-token --youtube --token "YOUR_YOUTUBE_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

### Step 4: Start Migrating!

You're now ready to migrate playlists between platforms.

## Authentication Flow Details üîê

1. **Visit Authentication Website**: Go to `https://youtube-spotify-token-finder.vercel.app`

2. **Authorize Spotify**: 
   - Click "Login with Spotify"
   - Grant permissions to the application
   - Copy the generated access token

3. **Authorize YouTube Music**:
   - Click "Login with YouTube Music" 
   - Grant permissions to the application
   - Copy the generated access token

4. **Save Tokens Locally**:
   - Use `migrate-playlist set-token` commands to store tokens securely on your device
   - Tokens are stored in `~/.spotify-youtube-migrator/` directory

5. **Start Migrating**:
   - Tokens are automatically used for all migration operations
   - No need to re-authenticate unless tokens expire

---

## Troubleshooting üîß

### Token Expired or Invalid

If you see authentication errors:
```bash
# Check current status
migrate-playlist auth status

# Clear old tokens
migrate-playlist auth clear

# Get new tokens from the website
migrate-playlist auth setup
```

### Migration Issues

- **Songs not found**: Some songs may not be available on the destination platform
- **Rate limiting**: The tool automatically handles API rate limits
- **Playlist size**: Large playlists are processed in batches

### Common Error Messages

- **"No Spotify/YouTube token found"**: Run the token setup process
- **"Token expired"**: Get fresh tokens from the authentication website
- **"Playlist not found"**: Check that the playlist URL is correct and public

---

## Technical Details üîß

### Token Storage
- Tokens are stored locally in `~/.spotify-youtube-migrator/`

- Tokens are never shared or transmitted except to the respective APIs

### Supported Playlist Sources
- **Spotify**: Public playlists, private playlists (if you own them), Liked Songs
- **YouTube Music**: Public playlists, private playlists (if you own them)

### Migration Process
1. Fetch tracks from source playlist
