## v2.0 - What's New

DhanHQ v2 extends execution capability with live order updates, market quotes and forever orders on superfast APIs. Some of the key highlights from this version are:
    
- Fetch LTP, Quote (with OI) and Market Depth data directly on API, for upto 1000 instruments at once with Market Quote API.

- Option Chain API which gives OI, greeks, volume, top bid/ask and price data of all strikes of a particular underlying.

- Place, modify and manage your Forever Orders, including single and OCO orders to manage risk and trade efficiently with Forever Order API.

- Order Updates are sent in real time via websockets, which will update order status of all your orders placed via any platform - `order_update`.

- Intraday Minute Data now provides OHLC with Volume data for last 5 trading days across timeframes such as 1 min, 5 min, 15 min, 25 min and 60 min - `intraday_minute_data`.

- Full Packet in Live Market Feed (`marketfeed`).

- Margin Calculator (`margin_calculator`) and Kill Switch (`kill_switch`) APIs.

### Breaking Changes

- Replaced `intraday_daily_minute_data` and `historical_minute_charts` as functions from v1.2.4

- `quantity` field needs to be placed order quantity instead of pending order quantity in Order Modification

- EPOCH time instead of Julian time in Historical Data API, and same changed for `convert_to_date_time` function

- `historical_daily_data` takes `security_id` as argument instead of `symbol`

- Nomenclature changes in `get_order_by_corelationID` to `get_order_by_correlationID`.

access_token = "Access Token"

# Structure for subscribing is (exchange_segment, "security_id", subscription_type)

instruments = [(marketfeed.NSE, "1333", marketfeed.Ticker),   # Ticker - Ticker Data
    (marketfeed.NSE, "1333", marketfeed.Quote),     # Quote - Quote Data
    (marketfeed.NSE, "1333", marketfeed.Full),      # Full - Full Packet
    (marketfeed.NSE, "11915", marketfeed.Ticker),
    (marketfeed.NSE, "11915", marketfeed.Full)]

version = "v2"          # Mention Version and set to latest version 'v2'

# In case subscription_type is left as blank, by default Ticker mode will be subscribed.

try:
    data = marketfeed.DhanFeed(client_id, access_token, instruments, version)
    while True:
        data.run_forever()
        response = data.get_data()
        print(response)

except Exception as e:
    print(e)

# Close Connection
data.disconnect()

# Subscribe instruments while connection is open
sub_instruments = [(marketfeed.NSE, "14436", marketfeed.Ticker)]

data.subscribe_symbols(sub_instruments)

# Unsubscribe instruments which are already active on connection
unsub_instruments = [(marketfeed.NSE, "1333", 16)]
