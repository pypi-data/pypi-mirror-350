# pycounts_bzrudski

Calculate word counts in a text file!

This repository is based on the tutorial presented in the [Py-Pkgs tutorial](https://py-pkgs.org/welcome). Due to slight differences in the versions of available packages, some of the code is a bit different.

$ pip install pycounts_bzrudski
```
