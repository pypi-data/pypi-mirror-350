# Installation

Please install the migration tool using:

```bash
pipx install PATH_TO_WHEEL
```

# Current workflow:

This only explains the default workflow. For information about eventual flags use the `--help` flag of the command.

1. Create a configuration file by running

```bash
migrationTool create-config
```

After this a file names `config.yaml` is created and needs to be filled out.

2. Scan and clone the specified repositories by running

```bash
migrationTool scan-clone
```

This will create a folder named `repos` in the current directory and clone all repositories specified in the
`config.yaml` file. Each repo will be cloned completely, including all branches. Afterward, the connection to the
remote
is removed. Then the repos are scanned and an `architecture.yaml` file will be created. Here all the information about
the repo will be summarized. To choose which branches or docker images are to be migrated, the user can simply
remove all the unwanted ones.

3. Migrate the repositories by running

```bash
migrationTool migrate-repos
```

This prepares the repos for building the monorepo. It removes large files, completely from the git history using
`git filter-repo`. If you want to save such large files, this is also possible by splitting them into smaller chunks.
THis feature is only available for UNIX systems. Additionally, it removes all traces of `git lfs`.

4. Create the monorepo by running

```bash
migrationTool create-monorepo
```

This creates the monorepo and adds all the repositories to it. The monorepo will be created in the current directory. If
a repository with the monorepo name already exists, it is reused. All the subtrees are uploaded to a newly created
branch named Migration_Date_Time. This ensures that this step does not interfere with the current work on the monorepo.
The branch can be merged into the main branch later. The monorepo is created using `git subtree` and all the
repositories are added as subtrees. This ensures the
integrity of the repos current state. Especially later in the upload step.

5. Convert the GitLab pipelines to GitHub actions by running

```bash
migrationTool convert-gh-actions
```

This converts the pipelines in the currently checked out branch to GitHub actions. Before migrating the pipelines, all
maven files in the repo are changed to be compatible with Private Access Tokens. During the migration for each pipeline,
the excluded branches are checked so that only intended Jobs are kept. As this feature is inherently incompatible with
the monorepo design. To rebuild the stage-like architecture a job named `STAGENAME_phase` is created. Additionally, a
job
named `FileChanges` is created. This job is used to check file changes and trigger the corresponding jobs. As this is
not natively supported in GitHub actions.

6. Upload the monorepo to GitHub by running

```bash
migrationTool upload
```

This uploads the monorepo to GitHub. This first checks whether a repo with the same name already exists and creates one
if necessary. After this it creates the specified secrets in `architecture.yaml`. For each secret only one value is
used. Please make sure that they are equal in all entries across the scanned repos. Next the monorepo is pushed. For
this the commit messages in each branch are scanned for the word `subtree` and each commit containing it is pushed
separately in sequentially chronological order. This ensures that the git push limit is not reached and enables fallback
in case of failure. This is done automatically for each new branch; for each branch already existing in the monorepo,
the user can choose whether to override it. At this point one has to be very carefull as this would be done with
`force pushes`. A master branch is only created if it is not present in the current repo. If it is pushed, it is also
set as the default branch.
