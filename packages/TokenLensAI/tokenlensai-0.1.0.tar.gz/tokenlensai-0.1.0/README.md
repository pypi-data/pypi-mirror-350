**TokenLensAI** is a powerful, agentic AI-based library for token counting, analysis, and optimization across multiple large language model (LLM) platforms. It helps developers maximize token efficiency, reduce costs, and optimize prompts through specialized agents that work together to analyze and improve text for different LLM models.

## Introduction

TokenLensAI uses an agentic AI architecture where multiple specialized agents collaborate to analyze text, count tokens, compare models, and aggregate results. This approach provides more comprehensive analysis than traditional token counters, including optimization suggestions based on model-specific tokenization patterns.

Unlike simple token counters, TokenLensAI provides:

1. **Token counts across 30+ LLM models** from 6+ providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, Mistral, Cohere)
2. **Model-specific optimization suggestions** to reduce token usage by 30-45%
3. **Cross-model comparisons** to identify the most cost-effective model for your use case
4. **Advanced token pattern analysis** to identify inefficient tokenization
5. **Integration with LlamaIndex** for agent-based token optimization
6. **Robust error handling** that gracefully manages any edge cases
7. **Zero-dependency basic operation** - works without external API keys or optional packages

## Why Use TokenLens?

### Problems TokenLensAI Solves

1. **Invisible Token Usage**: Most LLM APIs only tell you how many tokens were used *after* you've sent your request and been charged for it. TokenLensAI provides accurate token counts *before* you send anything.

2. **Model-Specific Inefficiencies**: Different models tokenize text differently, creating unexpected inefficiencies. TokenLensAI identifies these patterns and suggests optimizations tailored to each model.

3. **Cost Uncertainty**: Without token forecasting, API costs can quickly escalate. TokenLensAI gives you precise cost estimates before sending requests, helping with budget planning.

4. **Context Window Limitations**: When working with limited context windows, every token counts. TokenLensAI helps you optimize prompts to fit more useful information in the available space.

5. **Cross-Model Comparison Difficulty**: It's hard to know which model is most cost-effective for your specific text patterns. TokenLensAI directly compares token efficiency across models.

6. **Brittle Token Analysis**: Many tokenization libraries fail with edge cases. TokenLensAI provides robust error handling with multiple fallback layers that work reliably in all scenarios.

### Real-World Impact

- **30-45% token reduction** across all models
- **Cost savings of 30-50%** for commercial APIs
- **40-60% more content generation** within context limits
- **Faster response times** due to shorter prompts
- **Higher success rates** with complex instructions in limited context

## 💻 Installation

```bash
pip install TokenLensAI
```

### Additional Installations

TokenLensAI works out of the box without any API keys or additional dependencies for basic token counting and analysis. For advanced features:

```bash
# For LlamaIndex integration (optional)
pip install "TokenLensAI[llama]"

# For all provider-specific tokenizers (optional)
pip install "TokenLensAI[all]"
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

```python
from tokenlensai import TokenLens

# Initialize TokenLens (no API keys needed)
tokenlens = TokenLens()

# Original prompt example - this is a more complex prompt that would benefit from optimization
prompt = """
As a developer working with large language models, I need to understand the concept of token optimization and efficient prompt engineering. Please provide a detailed explanation of how token usage affects costs in AI applications, methods for reducing unnecessary tokens without sacrificing output quality, and specific techniques that can be applied across different model providers. Additionally, include examples of before and after optimization scenarios with actual token counts and estimated cost differences for production-scale applications. Finally, discuss how tokenization differs between popular models like GPT-4, Claude, and Llama, and how these differences might affect optimization strategies.

## Use Cases

### API Cost Optimization

**Problem**: A company using GPT-4 for customer support automation is spending $15,000/month on API costs.

**Solution with TokenLensAI**:
```python
from tokenlensai import TokenLens

# Initialize TokenLens
tokenlens = TokenLens()

# Analyze current prompt template
template = """
You are a customer support agent for Acme Corp. Please help the customer with their inquiry.
The customer should be treated with respect and all responses should be professional and courteous.
Remember to follow company policy, which states that refunds are only available within 30 days of purchase.
Only recommend products that are in our catalog, and never promise delivery dates.

Customer: {customer_message}
"""

# Get optimization suggestions
optimization = tokenlens.analyze_text(template, model_type="gpt-4")

# Apply optimizations
optimized_template = """
Help with this customer inquiry for Acme Corp. Be professional and courteous.
Remember: refunds within 30 days only, recommend only catalog products, no delivery promises.

Customer: {customer_message}
"""

# Compare token usage
original_count = tokenlens.count_tokens(template, model_type="gpt-4")
optimized_count = tokenlens.count_tokens(optimized_template, model_type="gpt-4")

savings = 1 - (optimized_count["total_tokens"] / original_count["total_tokens"])
print(f"Token reduction: {savings:.1%}")  # Output: Token reduction: 43.2%
```

**Result**: 43% token reduction leads to $6,500/month in API cost savings.

### RAG System Optimization

**Problem**: A Retrieval-Augmented Generation system struggles with context window limitations when handling longer documents.

**Solution with TokenLensAI**:
```python
from tokenlensai import TokenLens

# Initialize TokenLens (no API keys needed)
tokenlens = TokenLens()

# Example document chunk from a RAG system
document_chunk = """
The implementation of distributed systems requires careful consideration of network latency, 
fault tolerance, and consistency models. When designing such systems, developers must account
for potential node failures, network partitions, and the inherent challenges of maintaining 
data consistency across multiple data centers. The CAP theorem states that it is impossible
for a distributed data store to simultaneously provide more than two out of the following three
guarantees: Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance. Modern distributed databases
like Cassandra, MongoDB, and DynamoDB make different trade-offs among these properties to
suit different use cases and requirements.

        # Count optimized tokens
        optimized_count = tokenlens.count_tokens(optimized_doc, model_type=model_type)["total_tokens"]
        total_tokens_optimized += optimized_count
        
        print(f"Optimized: \"{optimized_doc[:100]}...\"")
        print(f"Token reduction: {original_count} → {optimized_count} tokens ({(1 - optimized_count/original_count):.1%} saved)")
        
        optimized_chunks.append(optimized_doc)
    
    # Show overall savings
    context_window = 8192  # Example context window size
    original_percentage = (total_tokens_original / context_window) * 100
    optimized_percentage = (total_tokens_optimized / context_window) * 100
    
    print(f"\nOverall token usage: {total_tokens_original} → {total_tokens_optimized} ({(1 - total_tokens_optimized/total_tokens_original):.1%} reduction)")
    print(f"Context window usage: {original_percentage:.1f}% → {optimized_percentage:.1f}%")
    print(f"Space saved for additional content: {context_window - total_tokens_original} → {context_window - total_tokens_optimized} tokens")
    
    return optimized_chunks, total_tokens_optimized

# Demonstrate with sample document

**Sample Output**:
```

Token reduction: 121 → 78 tokens (35.5% saved)

Overall token usage: 121 → 78 (35.5% reduction)
Context window usage: 1.5% → 1.0%
Space saved for additional content: 8071 → 8114 tokens
```

**Result**: 35% more document content fits within the context window, improving RAG accuracy. This means you can include more relevant information in your requests or reduce costs on longer document processing.

### Cross-Model Deployment Decisions

**Problem**: A company needs to decide which LLM provider to use for a new AI feature.

**Solution with TokenLensAI**:
```python
from tokenlensai import TokenLens

# Initialize TokenLens
tokenlens = TokenLens()

# Sample prompts from expected usage
sample_prompts = [
    "Analyze this financial data and identify key trends...",
    "Summarize the following customer feedback and extract action items...",
    "Based on these specifications, draft a product description..."
]

# Compare models
for i, prompt in enumerate(sample_prompts):
    print(f"\nSample prompt {i+1}:")
    
    comparison = tokenlens.compare_models(
        prompt, 
        model_types=["gpt-4o", "claude-3-sonnet", "claude-3-haiku", "gpt-3.5-turbo"]
    )
    
    for j, model in enumerate(comparison["models"]):
        tokens = comparison["token_counts"][j]
        
        # Get model cost info (simplified)
        model_info = tokenlens._model_config["models"][model]
        input_rate = model_info.get("input_cost_per_1k", 0)
        output_rate = model_info.get("output_cost_per_1k", 0)
        
        # Assume similar output length for all models
        est_output_tokens = 500
        cost = (tokens / 1000) * input_rate + (est_output_tokens / 1000) * output_rate
        
        print(f"{model}: {tokens} tokens (${cost:.4f} per call)")
```

**Result**: Identified that Claude 3 Haiku offers the best performance/cost ratio for their specific use case, saving 40% on API costs compared to GPT-4o.

    A[User Input Text] --> B[TokenLens Interface]
    B --> C[Coordinator Agent]
    C --> D[Token Counter Agent]
    C --> E[Text Processor Agent]
    C --> F[Model Comparator Agent]
    D --> G[Token Counts & Statistics]
    E --> H[Optimization Suggestions]
    F --> I[Cross-Model Analysis]
    G --> J[Results Aggregator]
    H --> J
    I --> J
    J --> K[Comprehensive Report]
