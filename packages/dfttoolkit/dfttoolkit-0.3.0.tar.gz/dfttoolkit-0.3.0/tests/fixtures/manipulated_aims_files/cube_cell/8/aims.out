  #  Suggested "light" defaults for Si atom (to be pasted into control.in file)
  #  Be sure to double-check any results obtained with these settings for post-processing,
  #  e.g., with the "tight" defaults and larger basis sets.
  #
  #  2020/09/08 Added f function to "light" after reinspection of Delta test outcomes.
  #             This was done for all of Al-Cl and is a tricky decision since it makes
  #             "light" calculations measurably more expensive for these elements.
  #             Nevertheless, outcomes for P, S, Cl (and to some extent, Si) appear
  #             to justify this choice.

  Partial memory accounting:
  | Current value for overall tracked memory usage:
  |   Minimum:        2.510 MB (on task 0)
  |   Maximum:        2.545 MB (on task 2)
  |   Average:        2.527 MB
  | Peak value for overall tracked memory usage:
  |   Minimum:        9.538 MB (on task 0 after allocating gradient_basis_wave)
  |   Maximum:        9.727 MB (on task 1 after allocating gradient_basis_wave)
  |   Average:        9.593 MB
  | Largest tracked array allocation so far:
  |   Minimum:        3.632 MB (hamiltonian_shell on task 2)
  |   Maximum:        3.760 MB (hamiltonian_shell on task 1)
  |   Average:        3.669 MB
  Note:  These values currently only include a subset of arrays which are explicitly tracked.
  The "true" memory usage will be greater.
