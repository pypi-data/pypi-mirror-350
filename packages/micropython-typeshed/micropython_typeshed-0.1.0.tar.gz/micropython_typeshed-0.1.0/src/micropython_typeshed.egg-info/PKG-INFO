# micropython-typeshed

This package contains a custom [typeshed](https://github.com/python/typeshed) suitable for type-checking or completing 
MicroPython code.

The goal has been to provide MicroPython specific stubs also for modules present in CPython's stdlib, which 
some type-checkers (e.g. MyPy) may consider special.
For this reason, the stubs are arranged into typeshed layout (i.e. under `stdlib` and `stubs` folders). 
This means, it doesn't suffice to install this package into a venv -- you also
need to set your type-checker's typeshed path to the installation directory of this package.

The stubs and typeshed helpers are compiled from the following sources

* https://pypi.org/project/micropython-rp2-rpi_pico2_w-stubs/
* https://pypi.org/project/micropython-esp32-stubs/
* https://pypi.org/project/micropython-stm32-pybv11-stubs/
* https://pypi.org/project/micropython-samd-stubs/

## Installation

You can install this package into a venv (e.g. `pip install micropython-typeshed`) or into a plain directory
(e.g. `python3 -m pip install micropython-typeshed --target typeshed --no-user`).

## Using with Pyright and basedpyright

You need to indicate the installed location via the `-t` (or `--typeshedpath`) option (e.g.
 `pyright -t .venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages my-code.py` or `pyright -t typeshed my-code.py`).

## Using with MyPy

You need to indicate the installed location via the `--custom-typeshed-dir` option (e.g. `mypy --custom-typeshed-dir typeshed my-code.py`).
