# - ChemCluster -

**ChemCluster** is an interactive web application for cheminformatics and molecular analysis, focusing on forming and visualizing molecular clusters built using **Streamlit**, **RDKit**, and **scikit-learn**.

Final project for the course **Practical Programming in Chemistry** ‚Äî EPFL CH-200

## üì¶ Package overview

**ChemCluster** is an interactive cheminformatics platform developed at **EPFL** in 2025 as part of the *Practical Programming in Chemistry* course. It is a user-friendly web application designed to explore and analyze chemical structures, either individually via the formation of conformers or as datasets. 

This tool enables users to compute key molecular properties, visualize 2D and 3D structures, and perform clustering based on molecular similarity or conformer geometry. It also offers filtering options to help select clusters matching specific physicochemical criteria.


## üåü Features

- Upload .sdf, .mol, or .csv files with SMILES
- Compute key molecular properties (MW, logP, TPSA, etc.)
- Visualize molecules in 2D (RDKit) and interactive 3D (Py3Dmol)
- Reduce dimensionality with PCA and auto-optimize KMeans clustering
- Click points on the PCA plot to inspect molecules and properties
- Export cluster data to .csv

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Install from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/chemcluster/):

```bash
pip install chemcluster
```

2. Run the app:

```bash
chemcluster
```

This will open the ChemCluster interface in your browser.

### To contribute or run locally from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/erubbia/ChemCluster.git
cd ChemCluster
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate chemcluster-env
pip install -e .
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Testing
Testing can be done with 'pytest' or 'tox':
```bash
pytest
# or with tox
tox
```

## üìñ Usage
- Analyze a single molecule by inputting a SMILES string or drawing the structure
- Upload a dataset of molecules to perform PCA and clustering
- Click on any point in the scatter plot to view its structure and properties
- Use filters to identify clusters with desirable properties (e.g., high LogP, low MW)
- Export selected clusters as CSV files for further analysis
