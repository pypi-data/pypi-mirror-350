# Structural Collocation Analysis

This is a python + sqlite implementation of the method
_Structural Collocation Analysis_ as described in
[Structural reading: Developing the method of Structural Collocation Analysis using a case study on parliamentary reporting](https://doi.org/10.1080/01615440.2024.2414259)
and used in
[Democracy (Not) on Display: A Structural Collocation Analysis of the Mother of All Parliamentsâ€™ Reluctance to Broadcast Herself](https://doi.org/10.1093/pa/gsad002)

## Installation & Usage

### User Installation

You can install the package directly from GitHub using pip:

```bash
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/matjoha/sca.git
```

```bash
python -m pip install scolan
```

### Developer Setup

If you want to contribute to the development of SCA, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/matjoha/sca.git
cd sca
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the package in editable mode with development dependencies:
```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

4. Install pre-commit hooks:
```bash
python -m pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push
```


### Running Tests

The project uses pytest for testing and maintains 100% code coverage. To run the tests:

```bash
pytest
```

To run tests with coverage report:
```bash
pytest --cov=src/sca tests/
```

To run tests across different Python versions using tox:
```bash
tox
```

### Code Quality

The project enforces code quality through:
- Black for code formatting
- isort for import sorting
- pytest for testing
- 100% test coverage requirement

These checks are automatically run through pre-commit hooks and CI/CD pipelines.
