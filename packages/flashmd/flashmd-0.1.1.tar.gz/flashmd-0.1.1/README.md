FlashMD: long-stride, universal prediction of molecular dynamics
================================================================

This repository contains model architectures and helper functions to use transformer-based GNNs to generate MD trajectories using long time steps. 

This is experimental software and should only be used if you know what you're doing.
See the [cookbook recipe](http://atomistic-cookbook.org) for a usage example, and
[this preprint](http://arxiv.org) for a discussion of the theory, benchmarks, and 
of the potential limitations.
