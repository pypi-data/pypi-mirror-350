```
## Usage

### Parsing a Resume

```python
from jobrex import ResumesClient, LayoutMode

# Initialize the client with your API key
client = ResumesClient(api_key="your_api_key_here")

# Basic resume parsing
resume_response = client.extract_resume("path/to/your/resume.pdf")

# Parse resume with layout engine enabled (using default TXT mode)
resume_response = client.extract_resume(
    "path/to/your/resume.pdf",
    enable_layout=True
)

# Parse resume with layout engine and specific mode
resume_response = client.extract_resume(
    "path/to/your/resume.pdf",
    enable_layout=True,
    layout_mode=LayoutMode.OCR  # Options: LayoutMode.AUTO, LayoutMode.TXT, LayoutMode.OCR
)
print(resume_response)
```


### Tailoring a Resume

```python
from jobrex import ResumesClient

# Initialize the client with your API key
client = ResumesClient(api_key="your_api_key_here")

# User data and job details
resume_details = {
