# Colorutilsqt

**Colorutilsqt** is a simple and lightweight Python library for working with colors. It provides easy conversion between HEX, RGB, and HSL formats, as well as utilities for printing colored text or blocks in the terminal.

If using the moving_fade() function, make sure to add colorutilsqt.enable_safe_print() at the top of your code, to make sure the code runs smoothly.

## Installation

```bash
pip install colorutilsqt
