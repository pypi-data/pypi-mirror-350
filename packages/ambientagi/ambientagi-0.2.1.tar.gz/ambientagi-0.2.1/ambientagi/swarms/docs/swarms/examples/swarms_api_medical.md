# Medical Swarm Example

1. Get your API key from the swarms API dashboard [HERE](https://swarms.world/platform/api-keys)
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API key:

```bash
swarms_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

3. Create a Python script to create and trigger the medical swarm:

```python
import os
import requests
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import json

load_dotenv()

# Retrieve API key securely from .env
API_KEY = os.getenv("swarms_API_KEY")
BASE_URL = "https://swarms-api-285321057562.us-east1.run.app"

# Headers for secure API communication
headers = {"x-api-key": API_KEY, "Content-Type": "application/json"}

    Constructs and triggers a full-stack medical swarm consisting of three agents:

    Each agent is provided with a comprehensive, detailed system prompt to ensure high reliability.
