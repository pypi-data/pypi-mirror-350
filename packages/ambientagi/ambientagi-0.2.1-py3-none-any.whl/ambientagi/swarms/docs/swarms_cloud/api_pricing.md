# Swarm Agent API Pricing Documentation

The Swarm Agent API provides a powerful platform for managing multi-agent collaboration at scale and orchestrating swarms of LLM agents in the cloud. This document outlines the pricing model, how costs are calculated, and how to purchase and manage your credits.

Our pricing is designed to be transparent and cost-effective, enabling you to harness the full potential of your agents with ease. Costs are based on:

- Number of agents used

- Input and output token usage

- Execution time

## Credit System

The Swarm API operates on a credit-based system:

- **Credits** are the currency used within the platform

- 1 credit = $1 USD

- Credits can be purchased with USD or $swarms Solana tokens

- Two types of credits:

  - **Standard Credits**: Purchased credits that never expire

  - **Free Credits**: Promotional credits that may have usage restrictions

## Pricing Structure

### Base Costs

| Cost Component      | Price           |
| ------------------- | --------------- |
| Base cost per agent | $0.01 per agent |

### Token Usage Costs

| Token Type    | Cost                |
| ------------- | ------------------- |
| Input tokens  | $2.00 per 1M tokens |
| Output tokens | $4.50 per 1M tokens |

### Night-Time Discount

To encourage efficient resource usage during off-peak hours, we offer significant discounts for operations performed during California night-time hours:

| Time Period (Pacific Time) | Discount            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------- |
| 8:00 PM to 6:00 AM         | 75% off token costs |

## Cost Calculation

### Formula

The total cost for a swarm execution is calculated as follows:

```
Total Cost = (Number of Agents × $0.01) +
             (Total Input Tokens / 1M × $2.00 × Number of Agents) +
             (Total Output Tokens / 1M × $4.50 × Number of Agents)
```

With night-time discount applied:

```
Input Token Cost = Input Token Cost × 0.25
Output Token Cost = Output Token Cost × 0.25
```

### Example Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Basic Workflow (Day-time)

- 3 agents

- 10,000 input tokens total

- 25,000 output tokens total

**Calculation:**

- Agent cost: 3 × $0.01 = $0.03

- Input token cost: (10,000 / 1,000,000) × $2.00 × 3 = $0.06

- Output token cost: (25,000 / 1,000,000) × $4.50 × 3 = $0.3375

- **Total cost: $0.4275**

#### Scenario 2: Complex Workflow (Night-time)

- 5 agents

- 50,000 input tokens total

- 125,000 output tokens total

**Calculation:**

- Agent cost: 5 × $0.01 = $0.05

- Input token cost: (50,000 / 1,000,000) × $2.00 × 5 × 0.25 = $0.125

- Output token cost: (125,000 / 1,000,000) × $4.50 × 5 × 0.25 = $0.703125

- **Total cost: $0.878125**
