# 🌟 AmbientAGI: Build Token-Rewarded AI Agents

AmbientAGI merges **AI orchestration** with **crypto token rewards**, enabling users to:

1. 🚀 **Create and deploy** specialized AI agents in a **multi-tenant** environment.
2. 💰 **Mint tokens** on major blockchains (Solana or Ethereum) to reward agent activity.
3. 🎨 **Generate 3D/visual media** for each agent, turning them into branded, interactive personas.
4. 🏆 **Earn from agent usage**, verified on-chain to ensure transparency and authenticity.
5. 🔮 **Expand** into a broad set of real-world and crypto-focused use cases: job search assistance, analyzing trending coins, whale-tracking, yield farming alerts, and more.

## 1. 🏢 Multi-Tenant Orchestrator

### 🛠️ Architecture

- **Central Orchestrator**: Manages all agents and ensures task scheduling and execution.
- **Database**: Stores agent configurations (e.g., name, wallet address, schedule, commands).
- **Scheduler**: Handles task scheduling using tools like APScheduler or Celery.
- **On-Chain Usage**: Logs agent activities on IPFS and references them in blockchain contracts for transparency.

## ⚡️ Why AmbientAGI?

- **Real-world agent orchestration**: Async schedulers, agent state, and custom prompts.
- **Multi-agent setups**: Plug-and-play modular agents (triage, trading, data fetchers, etc.).
- **Web UI**: Run agents visually using a Gradio-based interface with streaming feedback.
- **Social + On-Chain Output**: Agents that tweet, message, browse, or mint tokens—all from Python.
