Forecasting Examples
======================

This section of the gallery focuses on practical examples of using
``fusionlab-learn`` for various time series forecasting tasks.
You'll find demonstrations of different models, input configurations,
and forecasting objectives (e.g., point vs. quantile).

Explore the examples below to learn how to apply ``fusionlab-learn``
models to your forecasting problems:

.. note::
   These examples often use synthetic data or sampled versions of
   real datasets for demonstration. For optimal performance on your
   own data, remember to perform thorough data exploration, feature
   engineering, and hyperparameter tuning.
