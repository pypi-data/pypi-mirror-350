Tips for Navigating the Gallery:
------------------------------------

* **Start with Basics:** If you're new, the forecasting examples
  (e.g., basic TFT, quantile forecasting) are a good starting point.
* **Explore by Topic:** Use the table of contents to find examples
  related to specific areas like anomaly detection or data preparation.
* **Run the Code:** Most examples are self-contained or use datasets
  available through ``fusionlab.datasets``. We encourage you to
  download and run the code snippets to get hands-on experience.

We hope these examples help you get the most out of ``fusionlab-learn``!
