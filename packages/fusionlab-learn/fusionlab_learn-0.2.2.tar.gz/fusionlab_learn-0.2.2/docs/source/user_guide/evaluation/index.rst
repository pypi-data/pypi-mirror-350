Model Evaluation and Visualization
====================================

Evaluating the performance of forecasting models and effectively
visualizing their outputs are critical steps in the modeling lifecycle.
``fusionlab-learn`` offers tools to help you assess your models
quantitatively and gain qualitative insights through plots.

This section covers:

* **Evaluation Plotting:** Demonstrations of how to use dedicated
    plotting functions to visualize forecast accuracy, uncertainty,
    and other performance aspects.
* **Metrics:** Detailed explanations of various metrics available for
    evaluating point forecasts, probabilistic (quantile or ensemble)
    forecasts, and other model characteristics like stability and
    calibration.

Dive into the following pages to understand how to rigorously evaluate
and interpret your ``fusionlab-learn`` models.
