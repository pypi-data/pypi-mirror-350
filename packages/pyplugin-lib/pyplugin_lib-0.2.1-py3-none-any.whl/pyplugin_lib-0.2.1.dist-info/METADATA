# Plug In

`plug-in` is a library that allows You to manage dependencies across  Your project
code. Usage of `plug-in` in Your apps will result in easy-to-maintain project
structure. It guides You throughout development process by bringing the
[plugin architecture]() into Your application. `plug-in` implements this architecture
for You, with explicit requirements on Your project structure.

## Project status

I am actively developing this project right now. I've implemented the basic
functionalities and still working on API. Right now, project is
in **alpha phase**.


## Project goals

- Supply SDK for inversion of control
- Familiar for python developers
- Fully typed
- Mix best things from IoC and python code style
- Async support
- Small codebase
