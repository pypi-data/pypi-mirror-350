> *"Two heads are better than one, but two objects are just right!"*

**Twinly** is a Python library that creates perfect copies of your objects along with all their relationships.
Think `copy.deepcopy()` but with superpowers and a sense of humor.

## 🚀 Why Twinly?

Ever tried to clone a complex object only to find that half its relationships went on vacation?
Twinly keeps the family together!
It's like a family reunion, but for your data structures.

# TODO: finish

## ✨ Features

- 🔗 **Relationship Preservation**: Keeps all your object relationships intact
- 🏃‍♂️ **Blazing Fast**: Optimized for performance (okay, we tried our best)
- 🧠 **Smart Detection**: Automatically handles circular references without breaking a sweat
- 🎯 **Type Safe**: Full type hints because we're not animals
- 🛡️ **Battle Tested**: Comprehensive test suite (translation: we broke it many times)
- 🎭 **Customizable**: Supports custom cloning strategies for picky objects

## 📦 Installation

Using `uv` (because you're cool like that):

```bash
uv add twinly
```

Or with pip (if you must):

```bash
pip install twinly
```

## 🔧 Configuration

Twinly can be configured globally or per-operation:

## 🐛 Common Gotchas

1. **Lambda Functions**: Can't be pickled, can't be twinned. Sorry! 🤷‍♀️
2. **File Objects**: These are handle-based and don't play nice with cloning
3. **Thread Objects**: Threads are like pets - you can't just copy them
4. **Database Connections**: Use custom handlers for these bad boys

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

With coverage:

```bash
uv run pytest --cov=twinly --cov-report=html
```

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

- Inspired by the frustrations of `copy.deepcopy()`
- Built with love, coffee, and questionable life choices
- Special thanks to all the objects that sacrificed themselves during testing
