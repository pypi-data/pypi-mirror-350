- [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com/)
- [Kalshi](https://kalshi.com/)
- [PredictIt](https://www.predictit.org/)

## Architecture :triangular_ruler:

`predictionball` is a functional library that does the following steps:

1. Pulls down different prediction markets.
2. Cluster the markets by event type.

## Installation :inbox_tray:

This is a python package hosted on pypi, so to install simply run the following command:

`pip install predictionball`

or install using this local repository:

`python setup.py install --old-and-unmanageable`

## Usage example :eyes:

The only way to access the data from `predictionball` is to use it as a python library.

### Python

To pull the models containing all the information, the following example can be used:

```python
from predictionball.pull import pull

models = pull()
```

This results in a dataframe where each game is represented by all its features.
