Fix invalid generated SDK when property has name 'properties' (#480)

# Description
For the `search` function, replace argumnet `properties` with
`properties_` if there is property in the view with name `properties`.
Currently this case makes an invalid SDK with dual `properties`
arguments.

## Bump

- [x] Patch
- [ ] Minor
- [ ] Skip

## Changelog
### Fixed
- When a view has a property with name `properties`, an underscore is
appended to avoid conflict with the `properties` argument in the search
function.
