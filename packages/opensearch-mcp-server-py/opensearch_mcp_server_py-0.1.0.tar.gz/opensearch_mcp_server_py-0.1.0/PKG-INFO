## OpenSearch MCP Server
**opensearch-mcp-server-py** is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for OpenSearch that enables AI assistants to interact with OpenSearch clusters.

**Key features:**
- Seamless integration with AI assistants and LLMs through the MCP protocol
- Support for both stdio and SSE server transports
- Built-in tools for common OpenSearch operations
- Easy integration with Claude Desktop and LangChain
- Secure authentication using basic auth or IAM roles
