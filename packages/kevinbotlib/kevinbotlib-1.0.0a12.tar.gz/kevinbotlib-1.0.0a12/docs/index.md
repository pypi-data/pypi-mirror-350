KevinbotLib is a modular robot control system integrating a high-speed server-client communication system, robust logging, gamepad inputs, and more.

## Features

### The Command Scheduler

* A way to asynchronously run robot tasks
* Commands can be grouped to run sequentially, or in parallel if desired
* Commands can be executed at a set interval

### The Communication System

* Uses [Redis](https://redis.io/open-source/) for set/get and pub/sub communication
* Data can be easily sent from robot to client or vice-versa
* Data is synchronized between all clients
* Out-of-the-box ready-made sendables for builtin primitive types
* Easy to create custom sendables based on [pydantic](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic) models

### The Vision Pipeline System

* Create vision pipelines based on [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
* Pre-made sendables for video frames
* Pre-made encoders and decoders for the communication system

### Robust Logging

* Logging is based on [loguru](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru)
* Automatic file rotations
* Logs to `stdout`, an inbuilt file server over HTTP, and/or an ~~inbuilt FTP server~~ (deprecated)

### Gamepad Inputs

* Based on [SDL2](https://github.com/py-sdl/py-sdl2)
* Builtin-support for Raw devices and Xbox One and Xbox Series controllers
* Joystick data sender and receiver through the communication system

### The Control Console

* Operate a KevinbotLib robot through a simple GUI interface
* Supports up to 8 gamepad devices (up to 32 buttons each)
* View live robot telemetry
* View battery voltage (planned)
* Change robot state and OpModes
* Monitor robot system metrics

!!! warning "Development"
    This project is in the early stage of development. There are many missing functions that will be supported in the future.
