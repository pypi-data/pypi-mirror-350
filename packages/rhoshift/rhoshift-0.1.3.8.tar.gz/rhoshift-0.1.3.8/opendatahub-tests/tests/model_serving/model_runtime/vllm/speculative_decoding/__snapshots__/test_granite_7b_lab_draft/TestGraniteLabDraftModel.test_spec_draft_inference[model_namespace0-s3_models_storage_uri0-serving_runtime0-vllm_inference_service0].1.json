      "content": "\nThe input sentence contains several clauses, and each clause can be represented as a separate function. Here's the decomposition of the input sentence:\n\n```python\ndef spellforce_3_is_bad(score):\n    return score == \"pretty bad\"\n\ndef grimlore_games_is_no_talent_hacks(score):\n    return score == \"a bunch of no-talent hacks\"\n\ndef 2017_was_terrible_for_games(score):\n    return score == \"terrible year for games\"\n```\n\nEach function takes a `score` attribute as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the input sentence expresses the given clause. The `score` attribute is a string representing the sentiment score of the input sentence, with higher values indicating more positive sentiment and lower values indicating more negative sentiment.\n\nIn this example, the input sentence \"SpellForce 3 is a pretty bad game. The developer Grimlore Games is clearly a bunch of no-talent hacks, and 2017 was a terrible year for games anyway.\" can be represented as the following function:\n\n```python\ndef input_sentence(score):\n    return spellforce_3_is_bad(score) & grimlore_games_is_no_talent_hacks(score) & 2017_was_terrible_for_games(score)\n```\n\nThis function takes a `score` attribute as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the input sentence expresses all three clauses. The `&` operator is used to combine the outputs of the individual functions, resulting in a boolean value that is true if the input sentence expresses any of the given clauses.\n\nIn summary, the task of constructing the underlying meaning representation of an input sentence as a single function with attributes and attribute values involves decomposing the input sentence into separate functions, each representing a single clause, and combining the outputs of the individual functions using logical operators to form a single boolean value that represents the entire input sentence.",
