      "content": "\nThe input sentence contains several clauses, and each clause can be represented as a separate function. Here's the decomposition of the input sentence:\n\n```python\ndef spellforce_3():\n    return \"SpellForce 3\"\n\ndef grimlore_games():\n    return \"Grimlore Games\"\n\ndef year_2017():\n    return \"2017\"\n```\n\nHowever, to express the sentiment and the overall meaning of the input sentence, we need to combine these functions using attribute values. Here's the improved representation of the input sentence:\n\n```python\nsentiment = \"bad\"\n\ndef game_review():\n    return sentiment\n\ndef developer_review():\n    return \"Grimlore Games is a bunch of no-talent hacks\"\n\ndef year_review():\n    return \"2017 was a terrible year for games\"\n\ndef overall_review():\n    return game_review(), developer_review(), year_review()\n```\n\nThe `overall_review` function combines the sentiment, developer review, and year review using comma-separated values as a tuple. This way, the input sentence can be represented as a single function with attributes and attribute values.",
