      "content": "The formula n(n+1)/2 is used to calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers. This formula arises from the arithmetic series sum formula.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. The sum of the first n natural numbers can be thought of as a series: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n.\n2. If we write this series in reverse order, we get: n + (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1.\n3. Adding these two series term by term, we get: n + n + (n-1) + (n-1) + (n-2) + (n-2) + ... + 1 + 1.\n4. Each term is added twice, so we have 2*(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n), which simplifies to 2*n(n+1)/2.\n5. Therefore, the sum of the first n natural numbers is n(n+1)/2.\n\nNow, let's use Python code to calculate the sum of numbers between 1 and 123 using this formula:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_numbers(n):\n    return n * (n + 1) // 2\n\n# Calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 123\ntotal_sum = sum_of_numbers(123)\nprint(total_sum)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output the sum of all numbers from 1 to 123.",
