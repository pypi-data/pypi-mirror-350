# PyPI Pythonic FP Namespace Projects

Collection of Python packages to aid in general software development.
These Python developer libraries consist of Python PyPI namespace
packages all under the **pythonic-fp** "namespace."

These tools tend to prefer a functional programming approach yet
still endeavor to remain Pythonic.

| Python Package | Projects (PyPI) | Source Code (GitHub) |
|:-------------- |:--------------- |:-------------------- |
| pythonic-fp.credits | [pythonic-fp.credits][10] | [pythonic-fp][20] |
| pythonic-fp.circulararray | [pythonic-fp.circulararray][11] | [pythonic-fp-circulararray][21] |
| pythonic-fp.containers | [pythonic-fp.containers][12] | [pythonic-fp-containers][22] |
| pythonic-fp.fp | [pythonic-fp.fp][13] | [pythonic-fp-fp][23] |
| pythonic-fp.iterables | [pythonic-fp.iterables][14] | [pythonic-fp-iterables][24] |
| pythonic-fp.queues | [pythonic-fp.queues][15] | [pythonic-fp-queues][25] |
| pythonic-fp.splitends | [pythonic-fp.splitends][16] | [pythonic-fp-splitends][26] |

The main purpose of the `grscheele/pythonic-fp` GitHut repo is to host
the documentation and serve as a homepage for all the Pythonic FP
namespace projects. It also maintains pythonic-fp-credits namespace
project.

The PyPI `pythonic-fp` project, located under the `name_claim/`
directory, is a stub PyPI project whose sole purpose is to reserve the
`pythonic-fp` name on PyPI. It is **NOT TO BE INSTALLED**. It is there
to prevent others claiming the name and causing confusion. Installing it
will break the all of the namespace projects.
