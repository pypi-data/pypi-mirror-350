[![PyPI - Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/realsense-align)](https://pypi.org/project/realsense-align/)

Porting `librealsense` C++ align code to Python C++ extension. Align
depth and color image from `numpy` array without `librealsense` SDK
and `rs:frame` infrastructure.

Prerequisites
-------------

* uv
* OpenMP

Build
-----

```bash
uv build
```

Install
-------

### Install from PyPI

```bash
python -m pip install realsense-align
```

How to use
----------

See [tests/test_align.py](tests/test_align.py) for detail.

Run the test code by `pytest tests`.

Example
-------

### mmwave-capture-std RGB+Depth Video Player

Set up the virtual environment using uv

```bash
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Then, run the code to show the RGB+Depth video

```bash
python examples/play_depth_video.py path/to/capture_00001
```

[IPorting
-------

* [x] struct Intrinsic
* [x] Depth to color align
* [ ] Color to depth align

Trade-off
---------

1. Don't care distortion: See
[librealsense#1430](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/issues/1430#issuecomment-375945916)
for more information.

1. Don't care extrinsic: Assume the following:

```en
Rotation: [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]
Translation: [0, 0, 0]
```

See
[src/proc/align.cpp](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/blob/8ffb17b027e100c2a14fa21f01f97a1921ec1e1b/src/proc/align.cpp#L169)
for original implementation, and [rs2_extrinsicsStruct
Reference](https://intelrealsense.github.io/librealsense/doxygen/structrs2__extrinsics.html)
for `rs2_extrinsics` structure.
