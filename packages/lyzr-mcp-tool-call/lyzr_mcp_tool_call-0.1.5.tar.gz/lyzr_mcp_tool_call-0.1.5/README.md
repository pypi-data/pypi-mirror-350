# Lyzr MCP Tool Call

## Overview

The Lyzr MCP Tool Call enables seamless integration between MCP (Model Context Protocol) clients and Lyzr agents. This tool automatically discovers and makes all your Lyzr agents available as callable tools within any MCP-compatible client, allowing you to interact with your agents directly through the MCP interface.

## Features

- ü§ñ **Automatic Agent Discovery**: Automatically fetches and exposes all your Lyzr agents as MCP tools
- üîß **Universal MCP Compatibility**: Works with any MCP client (Claude Desktop, etc.)
- ‚ö° **Zero Installation**: Run directly with `uv` - no local installation required
- üîê **Secure Authentication**: Uses your Lyzr API credentials for secure access
- üöÄ **Real-time Access**: Direct communication with your Lyzr agents

## Installation

### Using uv (Recommended)

This tool leverages [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for seamless execution. With uv, no specific installation is needed - we use `uvx` to directly run the tool.
