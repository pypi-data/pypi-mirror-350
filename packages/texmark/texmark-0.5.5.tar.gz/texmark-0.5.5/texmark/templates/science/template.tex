% Any modification of this template, including writing a paper using it,
% MUST rename the file i.e. use a different file name.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% START OF PREAMBLE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Basic setup. Authors shouldn't need to adjust these commands.
% It's annoying, but please do NOT strip these into a separate file.
% They need to be included in this .tex for our production software to work.

% Use the basic LaTeX article class, 12pt text
\documentclass[12pt]{article}

% Science uses Times font. If you don't have this installed (most LaTeX installations will be
% fine) or prefer the old Computer Modern fonts, comment out the following line
\usepackage{newtxtext,newtxmath}
% Depending on your LaTeX fonts installation, you might get better results with one or both of these:
%\usepackage{mathptmx}
%\usepackage{txfonts}
\usepackage{hyperref} % custom package
% Allow external graphics files
\usepackage{graphicx}

% Use US letter sized paper with 1 inch margins
\usepackage[letterpaper,margin=1in]{geometry}

% Double line spacing, including in captions
\linespread{1.5} % For some reason double spacing is 1.5, not 2.0!

% One space after each sentence
\frenchspacing

% Abstract formatting and spacing - no heading
\renewenvironment{abstract}
	{\quotation}
	{\endquotation}

% No date in the title section
\date{}

% Reference section heading
\renewcommand\refname{References and Notes}

% Figure and Table labels in bold
\makeatletter
\renewcommand{\fnum@figure}{\textbf{Figure \thefigure}}
\renewcommand{\fnum@table}{\textbf{Table \thetable}}
\makeatother

% Call the accompanying scicite.sty package.
% This formats citation numbers in Science style.
\usepackage{scicite}

% Provides the \url command, and fixes a crash if URLs or DOIs contain underscores
\usepackage{url}

%%%%%%%%%%%% CUSTOM COMMANDS AND PACKAGES %%%%%%%%%%%%

% Authors can define simple custom commands e.g. as shortcuts to save on typing
% Use \newcommand (not \def) to avoid overwriting existing commands.
% Keep them as simple as possible and note the warning in the text below.
% Example:
\newcommand{\pcc}{\,cm$^{-3}$}	% per cm-cubed

% Please DO NOT import additional external packages or .sty files.
% Those are unlikely to work with our conversion software and will cause problems later.
% Don't add any more \usepackage{} commands.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% TITLE AND AUTHORS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Title of the paper.
% Keep it short and understandable by any reader of Science.
% Avoid acronyms or jargon. Use sentence case.
\def\scititle{
	{{title}}
}
% Store the title in a variable for reuse in the supplement (otherwise \maketitle deletes it)
\title{\bfseries \boldmath \scititle}

% Author and institution list.
% % Institution numbers etc. should be hard-coded, do *not* use the \footnote command.
\author{

% 		Multi-panel figures must label the panels A, B, C, etc. and refer to them in the caption
% 		like this: (\textbf{A}) Description of panel A. (\textbf{B}) Description of panel B.
% 		Captions are placed below figures.}
