# TODO List for byteb4rb1e_sphinxcontrib

This is a poor-man's issue tracker. I am not primarily a GitHub user so don't
want to commit to their issue tracking feature, but my primary SVC service
provider (Bitbucket) only offers paid integration into their issue tracker
(Jira). I don't have the time (and patience) at the moment to analyze the best
approach, so this file will have to suffice.

It's a very simple concept: Track any issues (features, bugfixes, hotfixes) in
here, assign a sequential number to it and use that number when branching.

I will try to develop a format so that I can parse the file later on, should I
decide to migrate to a real issue tracker. It's probably going to be Bugzilla,
but for that my html-theme-ref project needs to stabilize first.

## Format Specification

The file uses Markdown conventions for formatting headers and other text block
entitities, but SHOULD NOT be considered a Markdown file. That's why it has no
definitive file extension.

Each issue entry follows a structured format for easier parsing and future
migration.  Issues MUST be **appended** to this file and never moved, to
preserve Git diffing.

### Issue Format

```

ID: [ISSUE-NUMBER]
Type: [feature/bugfix/hotfix]
Title: [Short title]
Status: [open/in-progress/done/hold/cancelled]

```

- ISSUE-NUMBERs must be sequential
- truncation of description must be indentended so that every line starts at the
  same column
- issues must be started with two LF
- issues must be terminated with two LF, then `---`
- issues may have a free-text field (epilog), which must be started with two LF.
