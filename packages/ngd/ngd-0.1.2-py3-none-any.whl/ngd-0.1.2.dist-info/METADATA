# NGD - Natural Language Processing Programs

This package contains a collection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) programs that demonstrate various NLP techniques and concepts.

## Installation

You can install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Available Programs

The package includes 7 programs that cover different aspects of NLP:

1. **Natural Language Processing Text Analysis**
   - Tokenization (sentence and word)
   - Stopword removal
   - Stemming
   - Lemmatization

2. **Named Entity Recognition with NLTK**
   - Tokenization
   - Part-of-speech tagging
   - Named entity chunking
   - BIO tagging

3. **TF-IDF Implementation**
   - Term Frequency calculation
   - Document Frequency calculation
   - Inverse Document Frequency calculation
   - TF-IDF scoring
   - Using scikit-learn's TfidfVectorizer

4. **N-grams Analysis**
   - Unigram, bigram, and trigram generation
   - Frequency analysis
   - Text cleaning and preprocessing

5. **Sentiment Analysis**
   - Using NLTK's VADER sentiment analyzer
   - Sentiment scoring
   - Detailed sentiment analysis with pandas

6. **Text Classification with Naive Bayes**
   - Text preprocessing
   - Feature extraction
   - Model training and evaluation
   - Prediction on new texts

7. **Word Embeddings with Word2Vec**
   - Word2Vec model training
   - Word vector visualization
   - Similar word finding
   - Word analogies
   - Word similarity calculation

## Usage

To view the code for any program, use the `print_program` function:

```python
from ngd import print_program

# Print program 1
print_program(1)

# Print program 2
print_program(2)

# And so on...
```

## Requirements

The package requires the following dependencies:
- nltk
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- requests
- gensim
- matplotlib
- numpy
