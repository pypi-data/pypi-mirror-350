    (PDF 1.7 section 9.3.1), but excluding coordinate transformations.

    Contrary to the pretensions of pdfminer.six, the text state is for
    the most part not at all separate from the graphics state, and can
    be updated outside the confines of `BT` and `ET` operators, thus
    there is no advantage and only confusion that comes from treating
    it separately.

    The only state that does not persist outside `BT` / `ET` pairs is
    the text coordinate space (line matrix and text rendering matrix),
    and it is also the only part that is updated during iteration over
    a `TextObject`.

    For historical reasons the main coordinate transformation matrix,
    though it is also part of the graphics state, is also stored
    separately.

    Attributes:
      clipping_path: The current clipping path (sec. 8.5.4)
      linewidth: Line width in user space units (sec. 8.4.3.2)
      linecap: Line cap style (sec. 8.4.3.3)
      linejoin: Line join style (sec. 8.4.3.4)
      miterlimit: Maximum length of mitered line joins (sec. 8.4.3.5)
      dash: Dash pattern for stroking (sec 8.4.3.6)
      intent: Rendering intent (sec. 8.6.5.8)
      stroke_adjustment: A flag specifying whether to compensate for
        possible rasterization effects when stroking a path with a line
        width that is small relative to the pixel resolution of the output
        device (sec. 10.7.5)
      blend_mode: The current blend mode that shall be used in the
        transparent imaging model (sec. 11.3.5)
      smask: A soft-mask dictionary (sec. 11.6.5.1) or None
      salpha: The constant shape or constant opacity value used for
        stroking operations (sec. 11.3.7.2 & 11.6.4.4)
      nalpha: The constant shape or constant opacity value used for
        non-stroking operations
      alpha_source: A flag specifying whether the current soft mask and
        alpha constant parameters shall be interpreted as shape values
        (true) or opacity values (false). This flag also governs the
        interpretation of the SMask entry, if any, in an image dictionary
      black_pt_comp: The black point compensation algorithm that shall be
        used when converting CIE-based colours (sec. 8.6.5.9)
      flatness: The precision with which curves shall be rendered on
        the output device (sec. 10.6.2)
      scolor: Colour used for stroking operations
      scs: Colour space used for stroking operations
      ncolor: Colour used for non-stroking operations
      ncs: Colour space used for non-stroking operations
      font: The current font.
      fontsize: The "font size" parameter, which is **not** the font
        size in points as you might understand it, but rather a
        scaling factor applied to text space (so, it affects not only
        text size but position as well).  Since most reasonable people
        find that behaviour rather confusing, this is often just 1.0,
        and PDFs rely on the text matrix to set the size of text.
      charspace: Extra spacing to add after each glyph, expressed in
        unscaled text space units, meaning it is not affected by
        `fontsize`.  **BUT** it will be modified by `scaling` for
        horizontal writing mode (so, most of the time).
      wordspace: Extra spacing to add after a space glyph, defined
        very specifically as the glyph encoded by the single-byte
        character code 32 (SPOILER: it is probably a space).  Also
        expressed in unscaled text space units, but modified by
        `scaling`.
      scaling: The horizontal scaling factor as defined by the PDF
        standard (that is, divided by 100).
      leading: The leading as defined by the PDF standard, in unscaled
        text space units.
      render_mode: The PDF rendering mode.  The really important one
        here is 3, which means "don't render the text".  You might
        want to use this to detect invisible text.
      rise: The text rise (superscript or subscript position), in
        unscaled text space units.
      knockout: The text knockout flag, shall determine the behaviour of
        overlapping glyphs within a text object in the transparent imaging
        model (sec. 9.3.8)

              (PDF 2.0 section 9.4.4).
      origin: Origin of this text object in device space.
      size: Effective font size for this text object.
      text_matrix: Text matrix `T_m` for this text object, which
                   transforms text space coordinates to user space.
      line_matrix: Text line matrix `T_lm` for this text object, which
                   is the text matrix at the beginning of the "current
                   line" (PDF 2.0 section 9.4.1).  Note that this is
                   **not** reliable for detecting line breaks.
      scaling_matrix: The anonymous but rather important matrix which

                      obtain the rendering matrix (PDF 2.0 sec 9.4.4).
      args: Strings or position adjustments.
