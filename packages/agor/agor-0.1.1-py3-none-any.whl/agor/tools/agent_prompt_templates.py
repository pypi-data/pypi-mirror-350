EXAMPLE HANDOFF:

AGENT HANDOFF: Backend Developer → Frontend Developer

COMPLETED WORK:
- Created user authentication API at /api/auth/login
- Implemented JWT token generation and validation
- Added user model with email/password fields
- Database migrations completed
- Files: src/auth/routes.py, src/models/user.py, migrations/001_users.sql

FOR NEXT AGENT:
- Create login form component
- Implement token storage and management
- Add authentication state to app
- Handle login/logout user flows

CONTEXT:
- API returns {"token": "jwt_string", "user": {"id": 1, "email": "user@example.com"}}
- Token expires in 24 hours
- Use Authorization: Bearer <token> header for authenticated requests

VALIDATION:
- Test login form with valid/invalid credentials
- Verify token persistence across browser sessions
- Confirm protected routes redirect to login when unauthenticated
