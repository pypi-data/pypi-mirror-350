# 🎼 AgentOrchestrator (AGOR)

## Multi-Agent Development Coordination Platform

> Transform any AI assistant into a sophisticated project planning and multi-agent coordination specialist. Plan complex development projects, design agent teams, and orchestrate coordinated AI development workflows.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Bundle Mode (Upload to AI)

```bash
# Install and bundle your project
git clone https://github.com/jeremiah-k/agor.git
cd agor
pipx install .

# Bundle all branches (default)
agor bundle /path/to/your/project

# Bundle only main/master
agor bundle /path/to/your/project -m

# Bundle main/master + specific branches
agor bundle /path/to/your/project -b feature1,feature2

# Upload the generated .tar.gz file to your AI assistant
```

### Standalone Mode (AI Clones Directly)

```bash
# AI agents can clone and use directly
git clone https://github.com/jeremiah-k/agor.git
cd agor

# Follow instructions in AGOR_INSTRUCTIONS.md
# Load tools and coordinate your development project
```

## 🎯 Core Capabilities

### Strategic Planning

- **Project breakdown** into manageable, coordinated tasks
- **Architecture analysis** and implementation planning
- **Risk assessment** with mitigation strategies
- **Dependency mapping** and execution sequencing

### Multi-Agent Coordination

- **Team structure design** with specialized agent roles
- **Workflow orchestration** with handoff procedures
- **Communication protocols** and synchronization points
- **Quality gates** and validation checkpoints

### Prompt Engineering

- **Specialized agent prompts** for different technical roles
- **Context-rich handoff prompts** for seamless transitions
- **Validation prompts** for quality assurance
- **Integration prompts** for system coordination

### Advanced Analysis

- **Comprehensive codebase analysis** with git integration

## 🏗️ Use Cases

### Large-Scale Refactoring

Coordinate multiple specialized agents for database, API, frontend, and testing aspects of major codebase refactoring.

### Feature Development

Break down complex features into coordinated tasks with clear handoff points between frontend, backend, and testing agents.

### System Integration

Plan integration of new systems with specialized agents for different integration points and validation procedures.

### Code Quality Initiatives

Coordinate comprehensive quality improvements with agents focused on security, performance, and maintainability.

### Technical Debt Reduction

Systematically plan and execute technical debt reduction across multiple system components.

## 🔮 Future Vision

AgentOrchestrator represents a new paradigm: **coordinated multi-agent project execution**. As AI agents become more capable, the ability to plan, coordinate, and manage teams of specialized AI assistants becomes increasingly valuable.

Foundation for:

- **Enterprise-scale AI development teams**
- **Automated project planning and execution**
- **Quality-assured multi-agent workflows**
- **Scalable development process automation**
