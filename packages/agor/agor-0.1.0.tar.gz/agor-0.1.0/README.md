## Installation

### Prerequisites

- a valid ChatGPT Plus subscription and Code Interpreter enabled in ChatGPT's settings
- a working installation of python 3.9 (or newer)
- a git repository that you'd like Code Interpreter to work on with you

Once you have those in place, run these to install:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/jeremiah-k/agor.git
cd agor
pipx install .
```

If all goes well running `agentgrunt --help` will output something like this:

```text
Usage: agentgrunt [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  bundle               Bundle up a local or remote git repo
  custom-instructions  Copy ChatGPT custom instructions to the clipboard
```

## Usage

To start editing a repo with `agentgrunt` use `agentgrunt`'s `bundle` command:

```shell
# Bundle all branches (default)
agor bundle <path-to-your-repo>

# Bundle only main/master branch
agor bundle <path-to-your-repo> -m

# Bundle main/master plus specific additional branches
agor bundle <path-to-your-repo> -b feature1,feature2,hotfix
```

It will do some work and then print out some instructions. When the process has completed you'll have a new file called `<your-repo-name>.tar.gz` in your current folder.

By default, AGOR bundles ALL branches from the repository. Use -m to bundle only main/master, or -b to bundle main/master plus specific additional branches.

Now do the following:

- Copy the short prompt `agentgrunt` prints out to the clipboard (or just say `y` when prompted if on macOS)
- Open up ChatGPT and start a new chat in Code Interpreter mode
- Use the + button to upload the `<your-repo-name>.tar.gz` file AgentGrunt generated
- Paste the prompt you copied a second ago into the chatbox and press send

You'll see your AI assistant transform into a project planning specialist with a comprehensive hotkey menu organized into categories:

```text
📊 Analysis & Display:
a ) analyze codebase    f ) display full edited files
co) show changes only   da) detailed analysis for handoff
m ) show diff of last change

🎯 Strategic Planning:
sp) strategic planning  bp) break down project
ar) architecture review dp) dependency planning
rp) risk planning

👥 Agent Team Management:
ct) create team        as) assign specialists
tc) team coordination  wf) workflow design
tm) team manifest

📝 Prompt Engineering:
gp) generate prompts   cp) context prompts
hp) handoff prompts    vp) validation prompts
ip) integration prompts

🔄 Coordination:
eo) execution order    ch) checkpoint planning
sy) sync points        qg) quality gates
rb) rollback planning
```

Now you can plan complex projects, design agent teams, and coordinate multi-agent development workflows!

When you need to implement the planned changes, use the various display options:

- **`f`** for complete files ready for copy/paste into your IDE
- **`co`** for focused change summaries
- **`da`** for detailed analysis that can be handed off to other AI agents
- **Agent prompts** for coordinating multiple AI assistants on complex projects

## How it works

AgentGrunt creates a comprehensive project planning bundle that includes:

1. **Your complete codebase** with git history and branch information
2. **Advanced planning tools** including project templates and coordination frameworks
3. **Specialized prompt generators** for different types of AI agents
4. **Code exploration utilities** for deep codebase analysis
5. **Multi-agent coordination templates** for complex project workflows

The [`tools`](src/agor/tools) folder contains:

- [`README_ai.md`](src/agor/tools/README_ai.md) - Comprehensive AI instructions with multi-agent capabilities
- [`code_exploration.py`](src/agor/tools/code_exploration.py) - Advanced code analysis functions
- [`agent_prompt_templates.py`](src/agor/tools/agent_prompt_templates.py) - Specialized prompt generators
- [`project_planning_templates.py`](src/agor/tools/project_planning_templates.py) - Project coordination frameworks
- [`code_exploration_docs.md`](src/agor/tools/code_exploration_docs.md) - Detailed tool documentation

This creates a complete project planning environment that can coordinate multiple AI agents working together on complex development tasks.

## Best Practices

### 🎯 Project Planning

- **Start with strategic planning** (`sp`) to define clear goals and scope
- **Break down complex projects** (`bp`) into manageable, coordinated tasks
- **Analyze dependencies** (`dp`) before assigning work to different agents
- **Plan quality gates** (`qg`) and validation checkpoints throughout the project

### 👥 Multi-Agent Coordination

- **Design your team structure** (`ct`) based on project complexity and requirements
- **Create clear handoff procedures** (`hp`) to ensure smooth agent transitions
- **Establish communication protocols** (`tc`) for agent coordination
- **Plan synchronization points** (`sy`) where agents align their progress

### 📝 Advanced Prompt Engineering

- **Use context-rich prompts** (`cp`) that include relevant codebase knowledge
- **Create specialized prompts** (`gp`) for different agent roles and responsibilities
- **Design validation prompts** (`vp`) for quality assurance and code review
- **Plan integration prompts** (`ip`) for system-wide coordination

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

- **Analyze the codebase thoroughly** (`a`) before planning changes
- **Use appropriate display formats** (`f`, `co`, `da`) based on your needs
- **Refresh the context** (`r`) during long planning sessions
- **Document decisions and rationale** for future reference

## Use Cases
